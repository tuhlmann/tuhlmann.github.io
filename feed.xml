Scala compiler fails with Linux directory encryption
</title>
<description>
&lt;p&gt;I'm always quiet excited when a new release of my currently favorite Linux OS appears and so I was installing shiny Ubuntu 15.10 on a test machine a few days ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There aren't many visible changes even compared to 14.04 which I use for daily work. Still, there is progress and excitement lies in the new...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ubuntu- and I would guess any decent Linux distribution- offers a few out of the box ways to encrypt your data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One way is to let it reformat you disc the it likes it and encrypt everything (except the &lt;code&gt;/boot&lt;/code&gt; partition).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The other out of the box option is to choose the option to encrypt the users home directory only.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If neither of these options suits you, maybe because you can't allow Ubuntu to wipe out all your hard drive, you can set up encryption manually. That's what I do usually following &lt;a href='https://wiki.ubuntuusers.de/system_verschl%C3%BCsseln'&gt;this recipe&lt;/a&gt;, here's the &lt;a href='https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=de&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=de&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwiki.ubuntuusers.de%2Fsystem_verschl%25C3%25BCsseln&amp;edit-text=&amp;act=url'&gt;Google translation&lt;/a&gt; for all non german readers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But back on track to the topic of this article. For this installation I was trying to encrypt just the home folder, not the whole disk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Internally Linux uses a different mechanism for this. Encrypting the whole partition will setup the logical volume manager to create logical volumes within an encrypted partition. The above mentioned article describes the procedure in greater detail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Encrypting just the home folder uses a layer of &lt;a href='http://ecryptfs.org/'&gt;eCryptfs&lt;/a&gt; for this procedure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All great, no problems so far. The positive thing of this setup is that I only have to enter one password when booting my machine, not one for the encrypted drive and one to log in as me. The downside of course is it only encrypts the home folder. This may or may not be what you need.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On to &lt;a href='http://scala-lang.org/'&gt;Scala&lt;/a&gt; the main work horse for daily projects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compiling my current project suddenly threw a baffling IOException saying file name is too long!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After a bit of &lt;a href='https://github.com/dcaoyuan/nbscala/issues/9'&gt;googling&lt;/a&gt; I learned that this is caused by Scala's default behavior to create veeerrry long filenames.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The workaround apparently is to limit the length of the generated class file names via &lt;code&gt;-Xmax-classfile-name&lt;/code&gt;, but there are &lt;a href='https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/scala-internals/hNWuwWBJCOg/GwnqXxjnK58J'&gt;drawbacks&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, I didn't bother too much with this error but went ahead and set up encryption the usual way, encrypting the whole partition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If this article saves you some time along the sometimes bumpy road of software interaction that would be awesome...&lt;/p&gt;

Converting my old Wordpress posts to Markdown
</title>
<description>
&lt;p&gt;I was moving my old Wordpress site to a new statically generated version. Getting hacked sucks, you know...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This site is generated by &lt;a href='http://cryogenweb.org/'&gt;Cryogen&lt;/a&gt;, a fairly simple Clojure based site generator. Cryogen uses &lt;a href='https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/'&gt;Markdown&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href='http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/'&gt;Asciidoc&lt;/a&gt; files for posts and pages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now the task was to extract old posts from Wordpress and convert them into Markdown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are the outlined steps I took to get this done, maybe this list helps future convertees:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;First setting up an Ubuntu VirtualBox to reinstall my Wordpress site. I had teared mine down immediately when I was notified that it was hacked. If yours is still running- well, good for you.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Now, Wordpress has an export feature that allows you to export posts and/or pages into an &lt;code&gt;XML&lt;/code&gt; file. I used that to export all posts.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/posts/2015-10-05/wordpress_posts_export.png&quot; alt=&quot;Wordpress Posts Export&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Then came the fun part. I wipped up a short quick &amp; dirty Clojure script to read the &lt;code&gt;XML&lt;/code&gt;, extract the posts and important metadata and write them as &lt;code&gt;HTML&lt;/code&gt; files.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The script then reads back the &lt;code&gt;HTML&lt;/code&gt; files, uses &lt;code&gt;sed&lt;/code&gt; to search and replace old image paths and then uses &lt;code&gt;pandoc&lt;/code&gt; to transform the &lt;code&gt;HTML&lt;/code&gt; contents into Markdown.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The script is not polished and hardly performant. But if it helps someone, &lt;a href='https://gist.github.com/tuhlmann/d9f1e3237eb8f692eb71'&gt;here's the gist.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;style type=&quot;text/css&quot;&gt; @media screen {   .gist-file   .gist-data {max-height: 400px;} } &lt;/style&gt; &lt;script src=&quot;https://gist.github.com/tuhlmann/d9f1e3237eb8f692eb71.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cool part is the way it reads &lt;code&gt;XML&lt;/code&gt; and uses Clojure's zippers to traverse and transform it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have fun, Torsten.&lt;/p&gt;

ClojureScript Testing with Doo and Figwheel
</title>
<description>
&lt;p&gt;These days I was playing with strategies to run ClojureScript tests. Information about this particular topic is not too easy to find, so here's a short list of posts I found particularly useful:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href='http://www.lispcast.com/testing-clojurescript'&gt;How can you test ClojureScript applications and libraries?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href='https://nvbn.github.io/2015/06/08/cljs-test/'&gt;Testing ClojureScript code with cljs.test with phantomjs and figwheel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Unit test library used in these cases is &lt;code&gt;cljs.test&lt;/code&gt;. One way to run the tests is to add a test and runner configuration to your &lt;code&gt;project.clj&lt;/code&gt; (see the second link for an example).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another way is to use &lt;a href='https://github.com/bensu/doo'&gt;lein-doo&lt;/a&gt; as a way to configure all kinds of different test runners, like Karma, SlimerJs or PhantomJs, and also watch your source directories and run tests on file change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was playing with that Doo configuration in my project and ran into a strange error.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My project uses a figwheel configuration, and the funny thing is, figwheel barks on this piece of Doo config:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;:main 'example.runner&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;with the exception:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;java.lang.ClassCastException:
clojure.lang.PersistentList cannot be cast to
clojure.lang.Named
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;To get around this problem, write the Doo config like this:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;:main &amp;quot;example.runner&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Figwheel works again and even Doo still works :)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hope this might help somebody...&lt;/p&gt;

Tunneling SSH Connections
</title>
<description>
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;problem&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Problem&lt;/h2&gt;You want to access a firewalled server from your local machine which has a dynamic IP assigned by your internet provider that changes regularly. The server you want to access has a firewall that whitelists the IP addresses that are allowed to access.&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;solution&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Solution&lt;/h2&gt;The solution I found working for me is to tunnel all traffic to these restricted servers through a machine that has a fixed IP address, in my case a web server I use for lots of other purposes.You should be able to ssh into that server and add ssh keys. If the firewalled machine does not have a dns’ed IP address you may need to edit your remote server’s &lt;code&gt;/etc/hosts&lt;/code&gt; file to add these servers there.&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;browser&amp;#95;access&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Browser Access&lt;/h2&gt;In order to access a firewalled server with a browser, I’m using a SOCKS proxy that tunnels traffic through my remote server:&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;ssh -CN -D 9050 user@my-remote-server
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;This creates a SOCKS proxy that you can access at &lt;a href='localhost:9050'&gt;localhost:9050&lt;/a&gt;. I found it easiest to use with Firefox and the FoxyProxy plugin. You can give that plugin a url mask- if that matches it will use the SOCKS proxy, otherwise it will use the default connection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are my settings for the SOCKS proxy within FoxyProxy:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/posts/2015-09-21/foxyproxy_1.png&quot; alt=&quot;FoxyProxy SOCKS Config&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/posts/2015-09-21/foxyproxy_2.png&quot; alt=&quot;FoxyProxy Details&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Update 7.5.2016:&lt;/b&gt; As &lt;a href='https://twitter.com/d6y'&gt;Richard&lt;/a&gt; reports, if you are on a Mac you can configure its on board socks proxy like so:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;# enable it:
sudo networksetup -setsocksfirewallproxy Wi-Fi localhost 9050
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;# disable it:
sudo networksetup -setsocksfirewallproxystate Wi-Fi off
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;networksetup&lt;/code&gt; command also has an option &lt;code&gt;-setproxybypassdomains&lt;/code&gt; to exclude certain domains from using the configured proxy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;ssh&amp;#95;access&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;SSH Access&lt;/h2&gt;Establishing ssh access is a tad bit more involved, but not too much. It also uses a ssh tunnel through the fixed IP remote server.I set up a ssh config that allows me to type &lt;code&gt;ssh firewalled-server&lt;/code&gt; and get a connection from my dynamic IP, without having to login to the remote machine and open another ssh session from there.&lt;p&gt;In your &lt;code&gt;&amp;#126;/.ssh&lt;/code&gt; directory create a &lt;code&gt;config&lt;/code&gt; file that will contain entries like the following, separated by a blank line:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Host firewalled-server
Hostname firewalled-server
User my-username
ForwardAgent yes
Port 22
ProxyCommand ssh my-username@my-remote-server /bin/nc %h %p
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;On your remote server you should setup key based access by adding a ssh key to the authorized_keys file.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the name of your firewalled server is not known through public dns you need to add the name(s) of your firewalled servers to the &lt;code&gt;/etc/hosts&lt;/code&gt; file.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, from your remote server, you should ensure you can ssh into the firewalled server, have added ssh key based access and accepted the fingerprint of the firewalled server so it’s added to the &lt;code&gt;known&amp;#95;hosts&lt;/code&gt; file.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If it works to log in from your local machine to your remote server and from there login via ssh key to the firewalled server, you should be able to directly hit the firewalled server via:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;ssh firewalled-server
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unless, of course, we forgot something…&lt;/p&gt;

A New Time, a New Blog
</title>
<description>
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After torching my old site
(Wordpress, vulnerable, was compromised, bla, bla)
I was long thinking about what to do with the new.
I wanted to make it easier for me to publish new posts, and a bit
more tech savvy, that is. And I wanted to have a static site
that does not expose my server to all the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I first looked at &lt;a href=&quot;http://jekyllrb.com/&quot;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href=&quot;http://octopress.org/&quot;&gt;Octopress&lt;/a&gt; as they seemed to be the big
players in the field of static site generators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They worked ok. However I didn&amp;#8217;t want to learn Ruby if I wanted
to change some functionality. They also seemed complicated for
what I had in mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So after a while I ended up with &lt;a href=&quot;http://cryogenweb.org/&quot;&gt;Cryogen&lt;/a&gt;,
an easy to use and fairly simple static site generator written
in &lt;a href=&quot;http://clojure.org/&quot;&gt;Clojure&lt;/a&gt;. Since Clojure is the language
I want to dive in deeper that seems the perfect fit for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To start a new website with cryogen, first install &lt;a href=&quot;http://leiningen.org/&quot;&gt;Leiningen&lt;/a&gt;,
the Clojure build tool, and then type:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;listingblock&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;title&quot;&gt;bash&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;$ lein new cryogen my-site
$ lein ring server&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This create a new Clojure project from the &quot;cryogen&quot; template.
&lt;code&gt;lein ring server&lt;/code&gt; starts listening for changes in the posts and pages and
creates a web server that listens at &lt;code&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://localhost:3000&quot; class=&quot;bare&quot;&gt;http://localhost:3000&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As soon as you change contents or add a page it will re-create the static site in
&lt;code&gt;my-site/resources/public&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and you can write your posts and pages in Markdown or Asciidoc. To use Asciidoc just
add the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/cryogen-project/cryogen-asciidoc&quot;&gt;appropriate plugin&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;code&gt;my-site&lt;/code&gt; project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To publish the site simply copy the contents of this directory to your DocumentRoot
or a Github Pages repository, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing I&amp;#8217;m thinking about is adding client side search to my site via
something like &lt;a href=&quot;http://lunrjs.com/&quot;&gt;lunr.js&lt;/a&gt;, which seems like a cool
project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here it is, a new site, and a new blog. I hope due to a simple publishing chain
I will keep on posting stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

Simidude 1.7.0 Release Notes
</title>
<description>
&lt;h1&gt;Simidude 1.7.0 Release Notes&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, I released version 1.7.0 of the Network Clipboard Simidude. After a long hiatus around Simidude I decided to release a new version, &lt;strong&gt;completely free of charge&lt;/strong&gt;. If there is enough demand I will also open source the Simidude source code so others interested could take a peek and use it. As always, you can download the updated Simidude &lt;a href='http://www.agynamix.de/products/simidude/download/'&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and I suggest you do- it's now free for everyone. Have a great day, Torsten.&lt;/p&gt;

Simidude 1.6.5 Release Notes
</title>
<description>
&lt;h1&gt;Simidude 1.6.5 Release Notes&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, I released version 1.6.5 of the Network Clipboard Simidude. This release fixes some bugs and adds the following new features:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;If a source computer is no longer available to download the item from, in the past you would receive a notification dialog for each failed contact. The dialog now contains a checkbox to hide it for further messages. In the preferences you can reset this behavior.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;When you transfer a folder with multiple files and one file cannot be transferred then the transfer will fail for all files. This is handled now more gracefully- a message will appear listing the files that could not be transferred.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;As always, you can download the updated Simidude &lt;a href='http://www.agynamix.de/products/simidude/download/'&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and I suggest you do- it's free for everyone with a license. Have a great day, Torsten.&lt;/p&gt;

Simidude 1.6.3 Release Notes
</title>
<description>
&lt;h1&gt;Simidude 1.6.3 Release Notes&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, I released version 1.6.3 of the Network Clipboard Simidude. This one is a maintenance release - it mainly fixes a few bugs. Simidude did crash on older Mac OS X versions because the new global shortcut handling on Mac depended on a library compiled for Snow Leopard. I fixed this so that crashes are no more (at least, not because of this). I also updated the libraries that Simidude depends on on all platforms which probably also fixed a few bugs... As always, you can download the updated Simidude &lt;a href='http://www.agynamix.de/products/simidude/download/'&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and I suggest you do- it's free for everyone with a license. Have a great day, Torsten.&lt;/p&gt;

Simidude 1.6.2 Release Notes
</title>
<description>
&lt;h1&gt;Simidude 1.6.2 Release Notes&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, I'd like to cheerfully declare the release of Simidude version 1.6.2. This one is a maintenance release that adds a few features and a critical bug fix. There was one hard to grasp bug that some of you experienced when Simidude suddenly tried to suck all juice out of your computer's CPU. I was finally able to reproduce the problem and eliminate the course. Well, that's not to say that there aren't other causes for this type of problem waiting to be released but, that one is gone... New features:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Network Settings preference dialog has a new setting where you can enter IP addresses or network names that should be ignored when Simidude tries to find it's own IP address. This is useful if you regularly switch networks and do not wish to change the hard wired IP address (&quot;The machine's IP address&quot; field in the prefs) every time you change networks but you need to eliminate other network addresses that would pop up.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The installer has been updated. The old installer sometimes left the Updater icon hanging in the Mac OS X Dock. This problem has been resolved for the most part. If you do experience problems please let me know.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;As always, you can download the updated Simidude &lt;a href='http://www.agynamix.de/products/simidude/download/'&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and I suggest you do- it's free for everyone with a license. Have a great day, Torsten.&lt;/p&gt;

Simidude 1.6.0 Release Notes
</title>
<description>
&lt;p&gt;Finally!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href='http://www.agynamix.de/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/waterfall.jpg'&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.agynamix.de/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/waterfall-212x300.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title= &quot;Waterfall in Sequoia NP&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today I'm excited to release a new version of Simidude with some cool new features.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BIG NEW FEATURE&lt;/strong&gt;: Well at least I'm excited about this one. The Simidude hotkey support is now available across all supported platforms (Windows (32-bit and 64-bit), Mac (32-bit) and Linux (32-bit and 64-bit)). That means on all platforms you can now use a global hotkey to make the Simidude window and you can use a hotkey to paste the latest Simidude entry (basically &quot;Activate Item&quot; and &quot;CTRL-V&quot; combined). To enable global hotkey support on Mac systems I started an open &lt;a href='https://bitbucket.org/agynamix/ossupport-connector'&gt;source project&lt;/a&gt; that does just that.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Simidude tray menu now hold a menu entry &quot;Toggle Clipboard Monitoring&quot;- you can use that to switch clipboard monitoring on or off without the need to navigate to the main window.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I upgraded the Simidude installer which does a better job now integrating with the operating system, especially on Non-Windows systems.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fixing minor bugs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;As always, Simidude is available from our download page at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.agynamix.de/products/simidude/download/&quot;&gt;http://www.agynamix.de/products/simidude/download/&lt;/a&gt;. Enjoy, Torsten Uhlmann&lt;/p&gt;

Click2Dial with your Snom Phone and Mac Address Book
</title>
<description>
&lt;p&gt;A while back my old trusty FritzBox (PBX/router/fax/whatever) went south which actually was a good thing. Shopping for a new model I noticed that the newer versions of it (from 7170 onwards) support IP phones like the Snom IP phones I had lying around. When I had separate office rooms I used an Asterisk (Trixbox, in fact) pbx and Snom phones with it. After a switched solely to FritzBox these Snom's lied dormant- until now. One thing I liked about the Asterisk solution was a quick way to dial a phone number from an address book. Back then I used Windows machines with Outlook and the free Asterisk Outlook Tapi plugin that was available. Now the Fritzbox does not support click2dial for IP phone (at least I have not found this feature) but the Snom phone supports command URLs. So the URL:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;http://snom-user:snom-pw@snom-ip-address/command.htm?number=123456&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;will dial &quot;123456&quot; from your phone. &lt;strong&gt;Important Note:&lt;/strong&gt; To make this work you must disable &quot;Hidden Features&quot; in the Snom QoS/Security settings (I use firmware version 8 with my Snom 360). If these are enabled then basically these action URLs don't work. Now you can test the above URL from any web browser and test you got this end working. The other thing is the connection with Apple Addressbook. For this I have copied an AppleScript from &lt;a href='http://hints.macworld.com/article.php?story=20040317010729892'&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and adapted it to my needs:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Open the AppleScript Editor and copy and paste the above script. Save the script into &quot;Library/Address Book Plug-Ins&quot; in your home directory. After you restart the address book application and left click on the text next to a phone number there should be a line in the appearing menu that reads &quot;Dial with SNOM&quot;. &amp;#91;UPDATE&amp;#93; I have updated the script to automatically change the '+' in a number into '00', this way the number &quot;+49 123 45678&quot; would automatically get translated into &quot;004912345678&quot;. Now click there and let the dial begin... Enjoy, Torsten.&lt;/p&gt;

Simidude 1.5.1 Release Notes
</title>
<description>
&lt;p&gt;Hi everybody! &lt;a href='http://www.agynamix.de/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Sequoia_Bear.jpg'&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.agynamix.de/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Sequoia_Bear.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Sequoia Bear&quot; title= &quot;Sequoia Bear&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; I finally released version 1.5.1 of Simidude. This is mainly a bug fix version that improves upon version 1.5.0:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bug Fix:&lt;/strong&gt; I tried to improve the way Simidude finds its own IP address.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bug Fix:&lt;/strong&gt; Some people experienced creashes on older versions of Ubuntu&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bug Fix:&lt;/strong&gt; Some people experienced crashes when a hard coded network address was not available in the current network.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Feature:&lt;/strong&gt; I updated the used UI libraries to their respective latest versions. This might bring some improvements especially on Mac and Linux platforms.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;This version is recommended for all users. As always if you have any feature requests please let me know- loud and clear.&lt;/p&gt;

Apologies for the messed up news feed
</title>
<description>
&lt;p&gt;Feedburner sent out a pretty messed up news mail to my subscribers yesterday and I sincerely want to apologize. The problem might have been that I changed the setting of posts in my RSS feeds. That might have caused Feedburner to reset it's internal markers and make it misbehave. So in the end, it's my fault. I hope the problem ist solved with this last message to you folks. I really value your interest in Simidude news and it was not my desire to jeopardize that. So, have a great day, anyway. Torsten. PS: Please let me know if further problems exist.&lt;/p&gt;

Synchronize your media library with iTunes
</title>
<description>
&lt;p&gt;This article will show you how you can synchronize your media library (movies, tv shows and iTunes shows at the moment) with iTunes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;background:&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Background:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To understand my solution I'd like to share with you how my media setup works: I use eyeTV (great program btw) to record movies and tv shows. I then use Toast to cut out commercials and convert the file into Apple TV format. I then copy the media files unto a NAS (Drobo in my case) into a predefined directory structure (see below). To watch shows through Apple TV I first have to import them into my Mac Mini (the same that records the shows). I then have the Mac Mini connected to the Apple TV and let it stream media into the living room. So for that purpose the Apple TV is just an overly expensive iTunes connector that just works...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;how&amp;#95;does&amp;#95;it&amp;#95;work:&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;How does it work:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In order to have an automated process (synchronize your current media library with the iTunes library) I have written a small piece of software that does just that. iTunesMediaImport is a Java based cross platform software that is freely available at &lt;a href=&quot;http://code.google.com/p/itunesmediaimport/&quot;&gt;http://code.google.com/p/itunesmediaimport/&lt;/a&gt; When it runs it parses a defined directory structure, dissects the file and directory name and creates a proper iTunes entry. iTunesMediaImport is started from a command line terminal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;directory&amp;#95;structure:&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Directory Structure:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The important thing is that the media archive directory structure is what iTunesMediaImport expects. It knows 3 different kind of media types: iTunes shows, movies you recorded yourself and self recorded TV shows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;itunes&amp;#95;shows:&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;iTunes Shows:&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;For iTunes shows you point the variable &quot;itunesShowsPath.x&quot; (x is a unique number) straight to the &quot;TV shows&quot; folder. The content of that folder should be the folders of your iTunes shows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;movies:&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Movies:&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;For movies point &quot;moviePath.x&quot; to a folder that contains genre folders. Each genre folder contains the movie files that you file under that genre. So in my case I point the variable (from etc/mediaimport.properties) to: &quot;/Volumes/Drobo/Mediathek/Movies&quot;. This folder contains genre folders like &quot;Adventure&quot;, &quot;Action&quot;, &quot;Comedy&quot;. You can have as many and name them as you see fit. When the movie is imported into iTunes it will be filed under a genre category with that name. Then the genre folder contains your movie files. The file name of the movie will be used as it's name in iTunes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;tv&amp;#95;shows:&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;TV Shows:&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;TV shows are handled much like movies except there is another directory layer, the season folder. In mediaimport.properties you find a key &quot;tvSeriesPath.x&quot; that points to a directory that forms the root of my tv shows archive, &quot;/Volumes/Drobo/Mediathek/TV Series&quot; in my case. Then this folder contains the names of my tv shows, like &quot;Bones&quot;, &quot;Stargate&quot; or whatever your poison is. Now under that folder you need to define another folder named &quot;S&amp;lt;season number&amp;gt;&quot;, so &quot;Stargate/S3/&quot; would be the 3rd season of Stargate. Under the season folder you file the tv shows that belong to that season, for instance: &quot;Stargate 11 - Tokra.m4v&quot;. iTunesMediaImport will parse the file name backwards and stop at the first dash ('-') it finds. If it finds a number after the dash (looking towards the beginning of the filename) that number will become the show number in iTunes. The part after the dash until the end of the file name (except the .m4v extension) will become the name of the show. &amp;mdash; iTunesMediaImport will keep a log of media files it has added into iTunes in order to avoid processing them over and over again. It will also delete shows from iTunes that have been deleted or renamed in your archive. I invite you to give it a try, if you want you are welcome to contribute to it on Google Code. There's also a forum for it &lt;a href='http://helpdesk.agynamix.de/index.php?pg=forums.topics&amp;id=6'&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Have fun!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;references:&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;References:&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;iTunesMediaImport on Google Code: &lt;a href=&quot;http://code.google.com/p/itunesmediaimport/&quot;&gt;http://code.google.com/p/itunesmediaimport/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;iTunesMediaImport forum: &lt;a href=&quot;http://helpdesk.agynamix.de/index.php?pg=forums.topics&amp;id=6&quot;&gt;http://helpdesk.agynamix.de/index.php?pg=forums.topics&amp;id=6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;My website: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.agynamix.de&quot;&gt;http://www.agynamix.de&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

Use ASP.NET Forms Authentication with local Windows Users
</title>
<description>
&lt;h2&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This article shows you how to build your own MembershipProvider to authenticate users of your ASP.NET 2.0 web application against Windows user accounts using Forms authentication and the Win32 API method LogonUser. A few years back I developed a small ASP.NET 2.0 application for my customer. The requirement at that time was to authenticate users against ActiveDirectory. We did this using Forms authentication and the ADMembershipProvider that comes with the .NET framework. You would use the Web.config configuration file to define the access string and other parameters for ActiveDirectory access... But that's not the topic of this post... Anyway a few weeks ago that same customer asked me to change the authentication in order to validate against Windows user accounts. At first I had a hard time finding a way to use forms authentication in combination with Windows accounts. But eventually I found a few websites (for instance: here) that gave me the right clue: There is a Win32 function called LogonUser that can be used to validate the users credentials. I used that API method in a self made MembershipProvider (WinNTMembershipProvider) to implement an exchangeable authentication mechanism. Then, in Web.config I referenced that new MembershipProvider. That way I didn't have to change anything within the existing application, just a configuration change. Here's the essential part of the MembershipProvider that uses the LogonUser API method: You first need to announce the use of the LogonUser method:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;#91;code lang=&amp;quot;csharp&amp;quot;&amp;#93; &amp;#91;DllImport&amp;#40;&amp;quot;ADVAPI32.dll&amp;quot;, EntryPoint = &amp;quot;LogonUserW&amp;quot;, SetLastError = true, CharSet = CharSet.Auto&amp;#41;&amp;#93; public static extern bool LogonUser&amp;#40;string lpszUsername, string lpszDomain, string lpszPassword, int dwLogonType, int dwLogonProvider, ref IntPtr phToken&amp;#41;; &amp;#91;/code&amp;#93;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, within the ValidateUser method you try to log that user into the system:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;#91;code lang=&amp;quot;csharp&amp;quot;&amp;#93; public override bool ValidateUser&amp;#40;string strName, string strPassword&amp;#41; { bool bSuccessfulLogin = false; IntPtr token = IntPtr.Zero; //userName, domainName and Password parameters are very obvious. /&amp;#42; dwLogonType &amp;#40;3rd parameter&amp;#41;: I used LOGON32&amp;#95;LOGON&amp;#95;INTERACTIVE, This logon type is intended for users who will be interactively using the computer, such as a user being logged on by a terminal server, remote shell, or similar process. This logon type has the additional expense of caching logon information for disconnected operations. For more details about this parameter please see http://msdn.microsoft.com/en- us/library/aa378184&amp;#40;VS.85&amp;#41;.aspx &amp;#42;/ /&amp;#42; dwLogonProvider &amp;#40;4th parameter&amp;#41; : I used LOGON32&amp;#95;PROVIDER&amp;#95;DEFAUL, This provider uses the standard logon provider for the system. The default security provider is negotiate, unless you pass NULL for the domain name and the user name is not in UPN format. In this case, the default provider is NTLM. For more details about this parameter please see http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa378184&amp;#40;VS.85&amp;#41;.aspx &amp;#42;/ /&amp;#42; phToken &amp;#40;5th parameter&amp;#41;: A pointer to a handle variable that receives a handle to a token that represents the specified user. We can use this handler for impersonation purpose. &amp;#42;/ bSuccessfulLogin = LogonUser&amp;#40;strName, &amp;#95;userDomain, strPassword, &amp;#95;logonType, 0, ref token&amp;#41;; return bSuccessfulLogin; } &amp;#91;/code&amp;#93;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next thing is to reference the MembershipProvider in Web.config:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;#91;code lang=&amp;quot;xml&amp;quot;&amp;#93;       &amp;#91;/code&amp;#93;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here's the complete source code for WinNTMembershipProvider: Please note that most of the boilerplate here is not needed for our example, it's just needed to fullfill the MembershipProvider contract.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;#91;code lang=&amp;quot;csharp&amp;quot;&amp;#93; using System; using System.Collections.Generic; using System.Text; using System.Web; using System.Web.Security; using System.Runtime.InteropServices; namespace my&amp;#95;package { public class WinNTMembershipProvider : MembershipProvider { &amp;#91;DllImport&amp;#40;&amp;quot;ADVAPI32.dll&amp;quot;, EntryPoint = &amp;quot;LogonUserW&amp;quot;, SetLastError = true, CharSet = CharSet.Auto&amp;#41;&amp;#93; public static extern bool LogonUser&amp;#40;string lpszUsername, string lpszDomain, string lpszPassword, int dwLogonType, int dwLogonProvider, ref IntPtr phToken&amp;#41;; private String &amp;#95;strName; private String &amp;#95;strApplicationName; private String &amp;#95;userDomain; private int &amp;#95;logonType; private Boolean &amp;#95;boolEnablePasswordReset; private Boolean &amp;#95;boolEnablePasswordRetrieval; private int &amp;#95;intMaxInvalidPasswordAttempts; private int &amp;#95;intMinRequiredAlphanumericCharacters; private int &amp;#95;intMinRequiredPasswordLength; private MembershipPasswordFormat &amp;#95;oPasswordFormat; private string &amp;#95;strPasswordStrengthRegularExpression; private Boolean &amp;#95;boolRequiresQuestionAndAnswer; private Boolean &amp;#95;boolRequiresUniqueEMail; public WinNTMembershipProvider&amp;#40;&amp;#41; { &amp;#95;strName = &amp;quot;WinNTMembershipProvider&amp;quot;; &amp;#95;strApplicationName = &amp;quot;DefaultApp&amp;quot;; &amp;#95;userDomain = &amp;quot;&amp;quot;; &amp;#95;logonType = 2; // Interactive by default &amp;#95;boolEnablePasswordReset = false; &amp;#95;boolEnablePasswordRetrieval = false; &amp;#95;boolRequiresQuestionAndAnswer = false; &amp;#95;boolRequiresUniqueEMail = false; &amp;#95;intMaxInvalidPasswordAttempts = 3; &amp;#95;intMinRequiredAlphanumericCharacters = 1; &amp;#95;intMinRequiredPasswordLength = 5; &amp;#95;strPasswordStrengthRegularExpression = @&amp;quot;&amp;#91;\w| !§$%&amp;amp;/&amp;#40;&amp;#41;=\-?\&amp;#42;&amp;#93;&amp;#42;&amp;quot;; &amp;#95;oPasswordFormat = MembershipPasswordFormat.Clear; } //DFB: reads entries from web.config and initializes this class from those values // Once the provider is loaded, the // runtime calls Initialize and passes the settings as name-value // pairs in an instance of the NameValueCollection class. // public override void Initialize&amp;#40;string name, System.Collections.Specialized.NameValueCollection config&amp;#41; { if &amp;#40;config == null&amp;#41; { throw new ArgumentNullException&amp;#40;&amp;quot;config&amp;quot;&amp;#41;; } if &amp;#40;string.IsNullOrEmpty&amp;#40;name&amp;#41;&amp;#41; { name = &amp;quot;WinNTMembershipProvider&amp;quot;; } if &amp;#40;string.IsNullOrEmpty&amp;#40;config&amp;#91;&amp;quot;description&amp;quot;&amp;#93;&amp;#41;&amp;#41; { config.Remove&amp;#40;&amp;quot;description&amp;quot;&amp;#41;; config.Add&amp;#40;&amp;quot;description&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;WinNT Membership Provider&amp;quot;&amp;#41;; } base.Initialize&amp;#40;name, config&amp;#41;; foreach &amp;#40;string key in config.Keys&amp;#41; { switch &amp;#40;key.ToLower&amp;#40;&amp;#41;&amp;#41; { case &amp;quot;name&amp;quot;: &amp;#95;strName = config&amp;#91;key&amp;#93;; break; case &amp;quot;applicationname&amp;quot;: &amp;#95;strApplicationName = config&amp;#91;key&amp;#93;; break; case &amp;quot;userdomain&amp;quot;: &amp;#95;userDomain = config&amp;#91;key&amp;#93;; break; case &amp;quot;logontype&amp;quot;: &amp;#95;logonType = int.Parse&amp;#40;config&amp;#91;key&amp;#93;&amp;#41;; break; } } } public override bool ValidateUser&amp;#40;string strName, string strPassword&amp;#41; { bool bSuccessfulLogin = false; IntPtr token = IntPtr.Zero; //userName, domainName and Password parameters are very obvious. /&amp;#42; dwLogonType &amp;#40;3rd parameter&amp;#41;: I used LOGON32&amp;#95;LOGON&amp;#95;INTERACTIVE, This logon type is intended for users who will be interactively using the computer, such as a user being logged on by a terminal server, remote shell, or similar process.

Simidude 1.5.0 Release Notes
</title>
<description>
&lt;p&gt;Hurray, great news! I finally released version 1.5.0 of Simidude. This version fixed some important any annoying bugs and provides a few new features:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bug Fix:&lt;/strong&gt; Circling Clipboard Items: There where circumstances when a clipboard item was sent back and forth between connected clients.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bug Fix:&lt;/strong&gt; Wrong Sort Order of Clipboard Items: Sometimes clipboard items where inserted at the right position in the item list.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bug Fix:&lt;/strong&gt; Fixed Drag&amp;Drop on Mac: There where problems using Drag&amp;Drop on Mac systems.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bug Fix:&lt;/strong&gt; Runs on Ubuntu 09.10: Using new libraries problems while using Simidude on new Linux/Ubuntu have been resolved.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bug Fix:&lt;/strong&gt; Sometimes Simidude crashed right after the start if the computer's clipboard held certain data.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Feature&lt;/strong&gt;: Preference Setting to manually overwrite a clients IP address: You can enter a specific IP address in the network preferences if you want to force Simidude to that address and not auto detect the most probable primary IP address.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Feature&lt;/strong&gt;: You can now select which Clipboard items are being monitored: You can now enable/disable the monitoring of Text/Image or File items. That way you can for instance disable the monitoring of images copied to the clipboard when you only care for Text / Files.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Feature&lt;/strong&gt;: Network Analysis Dialog: In the Help menu there is now a &quot;Network Analysis&quot; dialog that shows information about connected clients and a connection history of received data (only statistical data). The Network Analysis report is appended to the Bug Report that can be sent from inside Simidude and is a useful debugging aid in case of connection trouble.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;This version is recommended for all users. As always if you have any feature requests please let me know- loud and clear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hi everybody, this is a short notice to let you know I released version 1.5.0 of the Network Clipboard and Drag&amp;Drop utility Simidude. It took me a while to finish this version but I believe I did hunt down and kill some bugs and also introduced some features. The release notes for this version can be found &lt;a href='http://www.agynamix.de/blog/simidude-150-release-notes/'&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.

Have a great day, Torsten.&lt;/p&gt;

AVG reports false positives for Simidude
</title>
<description>
&lt;p&gt;During the last few days I got reports from two customers that said the virus scanner AVG reported Simidude as a trojan horse: &lt;img src=&quot;http://www.agynamix.de/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/simidude-trojan-avg-300x166.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Simidude reported a Trojan Horse by AVG&quot; title=&quot;Simidude reported a Trojan Horse by AVG&quot; /&gt; As reported by the install4j people these issues should be resolved by now. You might need to update your AVG virus database if you were hit by this: http://forums.avg.com/ww-en/avg-free-forum?sec=thread&amp;act=show&amp;id=39669 Have a great day, Torsten.&lt;/p&gt;

BitsDuJour Sales Statistics
</title>
<description>
&lt;p&gt;Our last BitsDuJour day was on October 29 and went were well. That is, apart from the short server outage. Here's their Simidude page with some nice review comments from the customers: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bitsdujour.com/software/simidude/&quot;&gt;http://www.bitsdujour.com/software/simidude/&lt;/a&gt; This is the second time I have done this for Simidude, our cross platform network clipboard and file sharing tool. And this time as well as the last time I'm quiet satisfied with the results. I thought breaking out some numbers about the sales would be interesting for those of you who think BitsDuJour or one of the alternative sites would be an option for increasing sales of their products. On that day I sold about 64 licenses and refunded one. That is actually really great for my current situation. On normal month I sell about 2-5 licenses (which shows that I need to work on my marketing dramatically). &lt;a href='http://www.agynamix.de/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/fastspring-springboard-by-country.jpg'&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.agynamix.de/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/fastspring-springboard-by-country-300x250.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title= &quot;Sales Statistics by Country&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; The pie chart shows the distribution of buyers on countries. It clearly shows that Simidude's market is largest in the US. From the 64 buyers 30 used Paypal for payment, all other purchases were made with credit card. For those who like numbers here are some access statistics to the BitsDuJour site:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Simidude page at BitsDuJour was hit 3474 times&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Simidude was downloaded 154 times through BitsDuJour&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The checkout process was started 111 times- and 64 time it was completed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly during my first BitsDuJour day the Simidude page was hit nearly exactly as often as this time. I sold 10 more licenses, a reason for this might be the server outage... Now I hope the numbers help you to make an informed decision whether or not BitsDuJour can be a help for you. Have a great day!&lt;/p&gt;

A New BitsDuJour Sale is on the Way!
</title>
<description>
&lt;p&gt;Our last &lt;a href='http://www.bitsdujour.com/software/simidude/'&gt;BitsDuJour&lt;/a&gt; sale is a couple month back and it was quiet successful, so they invited me back for a new round.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href='http://www.agynamix.de/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/wasserfall.jpg'&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.agynamix.de/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/wasserfall-189x300.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title= &quot;Wasserfall&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So here we go. This time's &lt;a href='http://www.bitsdujour.com/software/simidude/'&gt;BitsDuJour&lt;/a&gt; sale will be on October 29. If you tried Simidude and find it useful then this is your great chance to get Simidude for a mere $9,95. If you didn't yet try Simidude &lt;a href='http://www.simidude.com/download/'&gt;download it now&lt;/a&gt; so you can make up your mind until October, 29. Simidude comes with a free 30 day trial license, so there's absolutely no excuse for not trying out :) During the last sale I gathered quiet a couple of nice reviews and comments about Simidude- you can still read them on their page... Oh, did I mention? Here's the &lt;a href='http://www.bitsdujour.com/software/simidude/'&gt;BitsDuJour link&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bitsdujour.com/software/simidude/&quot;&gt;http://www.bitsdujour.com/software/simidude/&lt;/a&gt; The current version of Simidude is 1.4.0 with 1.4.1 in the making. A license you buy now will be valid for all current and future releases of Simidude version 1. Also one license of Simidude can be used on multiple computers as long as you use these computers as one Simidude group. So if you want to send clipboard contents and files to one or more computers in your house you only need ONE license. I hope to hear from you on October, 29. As always if you have any questions &lt;a href='http://helpdesk.agynamix.de/index.php?pg=request'&gt;don't hesitate to ask&lt;/a&gt;... Have a great day, Torsten.&lt;/p&gt;

Simidude 1.4.0 Release Notes
</title>
<description>
&lt;p&gt;These are the release notes for version 1.4.0 of the cross platform network clipboard Simidude. Version 1.4.0 adds quite a list of new features that will make your use of Simidude more effective and fun:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Feature&lt;/strong&gt;: Simidude on Windows (32-bit) and Linux now supports global hotkeys to bring the application to front or to activate the latest Simidude entry into the clipboard. On Windows (32-bit) it does not just activate the latest entry but will actually paste the entry into the active application.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Feature:&lt;/strong&gt; You can now enable an option to show a balloon tooltip near the tray icon whenever a new entry arrives in Simidude.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Feature:&lt;/strong&gt; You can now enable an option to automatically activate a new arriving Simidude entry. Please note that the entry is only activated when it is inserted top of the list of entries.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Feature:&lt;/strong&gt; Another new option is to let Simidude automatically download remote files or directories.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Feature:&lt;/strong&gt; The user manual is now included with each Simidude distribution.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Feature:&lt;/strong&gt; When an item arrives in Simidude for a second time, the item is moved from it's current position in the list to the top. That makes it much easier to refind entries if the list is long.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;This version is recommended for all users. As always if you have any feature requests please let me know- loud and clear.&lt;/p&gt;

Run 32 bit SWT apps from Eclipse in Snow Leopard
</title>
<description>
&lt;p&gt;After I received an update for my UMTS modem driver to finally work with Snow Leopard I again decided to update my MacBook Pro to Snowy. After getting that system up to speed again I continued working on Simidude- I'm about to integrate global hotkey support- at least on Windows and Linux for now. Firing up Eclipse, editing a bit and launching Simidude brought me this error:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: Cannot load 32-bit SWT libraries on 64-bit JVM at org.eclipse.swt.internal.Library.loadLibrary&amp;#40;Library.java:182&amp;#41; at org.eclipse.swt.internal.Library.loadLibrary&amp;#40;Library.java:159&amp;#41;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Turns out that Snow Leopard tries to start Java applications by default with the 64 bit virtual machine which does not work with Simidude because I bundle it with the 32 bit libraries. Interesting enough when Simidude is launched from the Finder everything works fine... Now, drum roll please, the solution to this problem is pretty simple: Open up the Java JRE definition in Eclipse-&amp;gt;Settings-&amp;gt;Java-&amp;gt;Installed JRE edit your standard Java VM and add the following to the &quot;Default VM Arguments&quot;: &lt;em&gt;-d32&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href='http://www.agynamix.de/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/edit_jre_32bit.jpg'&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/uploads/2009/09/edit_jre_32bit.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title= &quot;Set the VM to 32 bit&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Happy Snow Leopard-ing...&lt;/p&gt;

New Simidude User Manual Published
</title>
<description>
&lt;p&gt;I admit, the Simidude user manual was very sparse and lacking much information. I have worked for the last few days to write up a new user manual that will hopefully be more informative for your and will answer more of your questions. Special thanks to very helpful user P. Jansen who provided me with a great starting point for this documentation. The manual is available as PDF from &lt;a href='http://helpdesk.agynamix.de/index.php?pg=kb.page&amp;id=6'&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. I will also include it in future releases of Simidude. Please let me know any things that I have missed in the manual, also if you'd like to see the documentation in any other format than PDF. Download the manual &lt;a href='http://helpdesk.agynamix.de/index.php?pg=kb.page&amp;id=6'&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Have a great day, Torsten.&lt;/p&gt;

Java Tip: How to find the location of a class being executed
</title>
<description>
&lt;p&gt;Today I wanted to find the location of a class file to make sure the class is really called from a specific jar file (old project with historically grown piles of archaeologically valuable code). Turns out this is pretty easy. For instance within the class you log the result of the following statement:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;URI uri = this.getClass&amp;#40;&amp;#41;.getProtectionDomain&amp;#40;&amp;#41;.getCodeSource&amp;#40;&amp;#41;.getLocation&amp;#40;&amp;#41;.toURI&amp;#40;&amp;#41;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;This will give you the exact place from witch the class was loaded.&lt;/p&gt;

Simidude 1.3.3 released
</title>
<description>
&lt;p&gt;A few days ago I release version 1.3.3 of Simidude, the cross platform network clipboard and drag &amp; drop utility. And now, after I'm sure its &lt;a href='http://www.simidude.com/blog/2009/simidude-132-withdrawn-again/'&gt;working this time&lt;/a&gt; I can even write about it :) This one is a maintenance release that doesn't add great new features but it fixes some bugs, renews used libraries and makes it all together more stable. A list of new features and bug fixes is available &lt;a href='http://www.simidude.com/blog/2009/simidude-13-release-notes/'&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. However I did realize that the update installer for Windows 7 is not working. So when the update checker of Simidude notifies you of an update you can download it but the update installer will then fail (only Windows 7). You can then quit Simidude and start the downloaded installer by hand. I'm sure we'll figure that one out as well... Anyway, go grab the latest release from our &lt;a href='http://www.simidude.com/download/'&gt;download site&lt;/a&gt; and have fun! Have a great day, Torsten.&lt;/p&gt;

Simidude 1.3.2 withdrawn - again
</title>
<description>
&lt;p&gt;I'm very very sorry for this trouble but today I had to withdraw my Simidude 1.3.2 release again. There is a major installer problem on the Mac side. I have reports from users that the Windows version works great, so no problem here. However I added a step to the installer to remove files from previous installations. I told the installer to delete the contents of the installation dir. On Windows this would be &quot;C:&amp;#92;Program Files&amp;#92;Simidude&quot; for instance. On Mac however this is &quot;/Applications&quot; because an application directory is treated as some kind of special file. Alas my installer tried to remove everything from &quot;/Applications&quot; which I only recognized today when I tried to read my mail and my Mail.app program was gone. Now thanks to Time Machine all the files get rolled back in place, but I sincerely hope no one of you guys was installing 1.3.2 on a Mac! After properly testing the installer changes on Mac Linux and Windows I'm gonna release a new version- again. Torsten.&lt;/p&gt;

Simidude 1.3.3 Release Notes
</title>
<description>
&lt;p&gt;These are the release notes for version 1.3.3 of the cross platform network clipboard Simidude. I published version 1.3.1 and 1.3.2 earlier this week but had to pull it back due to a problem with the installer. Version 1.3.3 is a maintenance release that fixed some bugs and brought a few new features:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fix&lt;/strong&gt;: Simidude saves the active clipboard entry to disk so that after a restart of your computer that item can be reloaded and will immediately be available to your system. That mechanism was broken and has now been fixed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fix&lt;/strong&gt;: Simidude caches files and directories that are transfered between computers into a special cache directory. That directories are removed when the application exits normally. In case of a crash that cache directories remain and will not be removed in the future. That has now been fixed. Cache directories that have no reference to a Simidude item will now be deleted.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fix&lt;/strong&gt;: Simidude crashed when you tried to access it through a browser but where using the server port, not the designated http port. That has been fixed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fix&lt;/strong&gt;: In some circumstances the written logfile could get huge. Writing of logfile entries has been limited to Error messages and a bug has been fixed that let log files grow endlessly. The Simidude logfile is contained in c:&amp;#92;Users&amp;#92;&amp;#92;.Simidude (Windows Vista and 7). It's surprisingly called simidude.log.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fix&lt;/strong&gt;: I added an installer option to delete old application libraries from Simidude's lib dir. That did not workon all platforms.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Feature&lt;/strong&gt;: The title bar of the Simidude window now shows the URL you can use with a browser to access it's entries- if http access is enabled.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;This version is recommended for all users.&lt;/p&gt;

Helpdesk works again
</title>
<description>
&lt;p&gt;After a day of bug hunting and help from the great guys and gals at &lt;a href='http://www.userscape.com'&gt;Userscape&lt;/a&gt; we were able to track down the problem to a wrong 'include&amp;#95;path' setting in the PHP preferences. I have absolutely no clue why this setting was changed during a PHP security update or if it has been there all along. Fact is the problem occured only after the update, and only in this one application. The value of 'include&amp;#95;path' was set to '.' in a global confixx file 'confixx&amp;#95;mhost.conf'. After commenting out the property the whole thing suddenly worked again. So go ahead and use the &lt;a href='http://helpdesk.agynamix.de'&gt;helpdesk&lt;/a&gt;. Have a great day, Torsten.&lt;/p&gt;

System Update killed my Helpdesk
</title>
<description>
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I updated the Ubuntu 6 Linux that runs my internet server that mostly serves my web sites. Having done this repeatedly in the past I didn't foresee any problems- which then came around the corner blazingly fast. Today I noticed that my helpdesk at &lt;a href=&quot;http://helpdesk.agynamix.de&quot;&gt;http://helpdesk.agynamix.de&lt;/a&gt; isn't working while all other sites are. I'm not sure what caused the problem but rest assured that I am working on it. Meanwhile if you have any questions please email me directly at &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:&amp;#x54;&amp;#x2e;U&amp;#x68;l&amp;#x6d;a&amp;#x6e;&amp;#x6e;&amp;#x40;&amp;#x61;&amp;#x67;y&amp;#x6e;ami&amp;#x78;.&amp;#x64;e&quot;&gt;&amp;#x54;&amp;#x2e;U&amp;#x68;l&amp;#x6d;a&amp;#x6e;&amp;#x6e;&amp;#x40;&amp;#x61;&amp;#x67;y&amp;#x6e;ami&amp;#x78;.&amp;#x64;e&lt;/a&gt;. Thanks, Torsten.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>
Version 1.3.0 of AGYNAMIX Simidude, the cross platform network clipboard is available
</title>
<description>
&lt;p&gt;Finally! After a short beta period I have now released version 1.3.0 of AGYNAMIX Simidude, my cross platform network clipboard and file copy tool. I did not get around to create new and shiny screenshots yet- I'll post them as soon as possible! This one is a pretty big release with huge improvements in usability and features. Here is a list of new features that were added since version 1.2.0:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An embedded HTTP server&lt;/strong&gt;. The embedded HTTP server allows you to access Simidude entries from any machines that has a browser installed. This is useful if you want to access Simidude but have no permission to install your own software, maybe because you’re setting up your client’s machine and want to use Simidude to transfer data back and forth. Here is a more &lt;a href='../blog/2009/version-13-beta-of-the-network-clipboard-agynamix-simidude-is-coming/'&gt;in depth article&lt;/a&gt; about this new exiting feature.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Save compressed…&lt;/strong&gt; Simidude now offers a way to quickly save any text, image, file or directory in ZIP compressed format. To do this simply right click on an entry and choose “Save compressed…”. That is actually the most efficient way to get some text stuffed into a compressed file: copy the text passage to clipboard, after it occurs in Simidude click “Save compressed…”, change the file name if you want and hit that big “Save” button. That’s it you’re done.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Restore the Clipboard after a reboot.&lt;/strong&gt; There is now an option in the preferences, if set the current content of the clipboard will be saved to disk. After a restart Simidude checks if the clipboard is still empty. If that is the case the saved entry will be restored. It was a bit hard to test because I didn’t find a way to really empty the clipboard (on Mac) other then rebooting the machine…&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some minor GUI improvements.&lt;/strong&gt; There is no Exit-Button in the toolbar any more that might have caused trouble.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Finally there are 64bit releases for Windows and Linux. I have tested them on Windows 64bit and Ubuntu 64. If you have a 64 bit machine please make sure to try them out and report back any misbehavior.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A list of IP addresses or network names to connect after launch.&lt;/strong&gt; In the preferences you can now add IP addresses or network names of machines you wish to always connect to. This option is intended to be used to connect to machines in different subnets or in those rare cases when your network configuration prohibits the sending of broadcast messages which Simidude uses to find other clients.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The modifier key can be changed.&lt;/strong&gt; Available options are: &quot;Ctrl&quot; on Windows or &quot;Apple&quot; on Mac, &quot;Shift&quot; and &quot;Alt&quot;. The modifier key for instance alternates the behavior of a double click on a Simidude entry. Without holding the modifier key the entry will be opened in the chosen application (see below), holding the modifier key activates that clicked entry (puts it into the clipboard)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Select an application for opening Simidude entries.&lt;/strong&gt; In the preferences you can now set an application for each entry type (Text, Image or File/Folder). When double clicking of a Simidude entry that data will then be opened within the specified application.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;This new and exciting version can be found on our &lt;a href='http://www.simidude.com/download'&gt;download page&lt;/a&gt;. If you have suggestions or questions please use our &lt;a href='http://helpdesk.agynamix.de/index.php?pg=request'&gt;helpdesk&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href='mailto:contact@agynamix.de'&gt;email address&lt;/a&gt; to contact us. We are excited to hear from you! Have a great day!&lt;/p&gt;

Beta 1 of AGYNAMIX Simidude, the cross platform network clipboard is available
</title>
<description>
&lt;p&gt;Hi everybody, thanks for waiting so long! Today I release the first beta of Simidude 1.3.0 to the public. I'm using this version internally but still, it's not as widely tested as 1.2.0. These are some of the new features of Simidude 1.3.0:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An embedded HTTP server&lt;/strong&gt;. The embedded HTTP server allows you to access Simidude entries from any machines that has a browser installed. This is useful if you want to access Simidude but have no permission to install your own software, maybe because you're setting up your client's machine and want to use Simidude to transfer data back and forth. Here is a more &lt;a href='http://www.simidude.com/blog/2009/version-13-beta-of-the-network-clipboard-agynamix-simidude-is-coming/'&gt;in depth article&lt;/a&gt; about this new exiting feature.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Save compressed...&lt;/strong&gt; Simidude now offers a way to quickly save any text, image, file or directory in ZIP compressed format. To do this simply right click on an entry and choose &quot;Save compressed...&quot;. That is actually the most efficient way to get some text stuffed into a compressed file: copy the text passage to clipboard, after it occurs in Simidude click &quot;Save compressed...&quot;, change the file name if you want and hit that big &quot;Save&quot; button.

I have tested them on Windows 64bit and Ubuntu 64. If you have a 64 bit machine please make sure to try them out and report back any misbehavior.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;So here we go. I do not yet add the beta release to the update notifier. If you want to try it out please download the beta from here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href='/img/uploads/2009/05/simidude-win32-1_3_0b1.exe'&gt;Simidude 1.3.0b1 for Windows 32bit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href='/img/uploads/2009/05/simidude-win64-1_3_0b11.exe'&gt;Simidude 1.3.0b1 for Windows 64bit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href='/img/uploads/2009/05/simidude-osx-1_3_0b1.dmg'&gt;Simidude 1.3.0b1 for Mac OS X&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href='/img/uploads/2009/05/simidude-linux_x86-1_3_0b1.sh'&gt;Simidude 1.3.0b1 for Linux 32bit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href='/img/uploads/2009/05/simidude-linux_x86_64-1_3_0b1.sh'&gt;Simidude 1.3.0b1 for Linux 64bit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Please send your suggestions or bug reports to &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:&amp;#x63;&amp;#x6f;&amp;#x6e;&amp;#x74;a&amp;#x63;&amp;#x74;@&amp;#x61;g&amp;#x79;n&amp;#x61;&amp;#x6d;i&amp;#x78;.&amp;#x64;&amp;#x65;&quot;&gt;&amp;#x63;&amp;#x6f;&amp;#x6e;&amp;#x74;a&amp;#x63;&amp;#x74;@&amp;#x61;g&amp;#x79;n&amp;#x61;&amp;#x6d;i&amp;#x78;.&amp;#x64;&amp;#x65;&lt;/a&gt; or better yet use the &lt;a href='http://helpdesk.agynamix.de/index.php?pg=request'&gt;web form&lt;/a&gt;- thanks!&lt;/p&gt;

Version 1.3 Beta of the Network Clipboard AGYNAMIX Simidude is coming
</title>
<description>
&lt;p&gt;It has been quiet around here for a while, I know. I had been way too busy with that boring stuff that pays my bills. Yet I managed to scratch of time to work on Simidude. I got a lot of feedback from my customers and with the next version 1.3 and the following one I'm trying to incorporate those requests. So here's a first sneak peak of a major new feature in version 1.3: &lt;a href='/img/uploads/2009/05/simidude-remote-access.jpg'&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/uploads/2009/05/simidude-remote-access.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title= &quot;Simidude Remote Access&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Version 1.3 will come along with an embedded HTTP server. I have implemented that thing myself and didn't take some out of the box servlet container to make sure the memory footprint doesn't jump into the skies. The HTTP server is very simplistic- in this version it will allow you to browse all entries, select a specific one for preview and then download that entry as is or as a ZIP file. This feature was requested by people who use Simidude to install new machines where they're not allowed to install their own software. Since a browser should be present on any machine with some kind of windowing system they can drag their setup files unto Simidude on one machine and then access that list of files via a browser from the machine they wish to setup. They just need to make sure the browser is installed before trying to use it :) As another new feature I have added compression of entries. You can now save an entry as a compressed ZIP file which might come in handy for instance if you quickly want to convert clipboard text into a compressed file. This is a new option which I will add to the main Simidude gui before releasing 1.3. Please note that when downloading directories via the browser view they will always be compressed and then served as one big file. Some users have requested an option to save the latest clipboard contents before Simidude stops and then reload that contents later. Using this feature Simidude could restore the clipboard contents after a reboot for instance. This is a small and handy feature which I'm also trying to put into 1.3. After the 1.3 release which I want to send out beginning of June if no show stopping bugs are found I will do some gui cleanup and improvements that make the application easier and more fun to use. If you have feature requests for Simidude for an upcoming release please let me know! I'm working hard on this release over the coming weekend. If someone would like to volunteer as a beta tester please give me a note! The communication protocol did not change so you do not need to update all your Simidude installations, just one. The new version will talk to the older ones just fine. This update will be free to all existing customers. Have a great day, Torsten.&lt;/p&gt;

Java Tip: Find the call path (stack trace) of a method
</title>
<description>
&lt;p&gt;Here is a little tip that can save you some time and trouble every now and then. Sometimes when hunting down bugs it is necessary to find out the path a method is called from in order to determine the root of a problem. Here's how you do this quiet easily. In there method that you observe add the following:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;System.out.println&amp;#40;&amp;quot;I'm here:&amp;quot;&amp;#41;; Exception e = new Exception&amp;#40;&amp;#41;; e.printStackTrace&amp;#40;&amp;#41;;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have a logger in place which you should you could write it this way:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;log.isDebugEnabled&amp;#40;&amp;#41; { log.debug&amp;#40;&amp;quot;Call of Method X&amp;quot;, new Exception&amp;#40;&amp;#41;&amp;#41;; }&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;The logger will only process the expensive part of creating the exception and retrieving the stack trace if it will be written somewhere. Remember, exceptions are just Java classes with some built in behavior. You can create and use them and also subclass and extend them. Sometimes it is useful to create custom exceptions that carry additional meaningful information that your code needs in order to resolve the problematic situation that caused the exception. But who keeps you from creating an exception and not throwing it- just use some of its powers...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My name is Torsten Uhlmann, I’m founder of &lt;a href='http://www.agynamix.de/'&gt;AGYNAMIX&lt;/a&gt;, a tiny (sooo tiiiny its just me) software company specializing in Java software consulting for larger corporations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I also develop &lt;a href='http://www.simidude.com/'&gt;Simidude&lt;/a&gt;, an easy to use cross platform network clipboard and Drag &amp; Drop tool which you might happen to find useful.&lt;/p&gt;

Why my Mac's key chain always got locked
</title>
<description>
&lt;p&gt;During the last couple of weeksI recognized an annoying problem with my Mac: Every now and then the standard key chain got locked and I had to enter my password over and over so that depending application could run. The Backup application would not work because it required the key chain password to be entered. As a possible solution to that problem the apple hotline suggested to run the disk utility application and check and fix potential file systems problems. But of course that wouldn't work- would be way too easy... After a lot of frustration I decided to reinstall my Mac. I'm used to that from my Windows machines, so no big deal :) I reinstalled Leopard and restored the user directory from Time Capsule (which worked like a charm). I was careful not to restore existing applications so that I would not take the original problem back. Now everything worked fine- until I installed &lt;a href='http://www.sshkeychain.org/'&gt;Sshkeychain&lt;/a&gt;! &lt;a href='http://www.sshkeychain.org/'&gt;Sshkeychain&lt;/a&gt; is a great utility application that manages your ssh keys for you so that you can use them with ssh or &lt;a href='http://cyberduck.ch/'&gt;Cyberduck&lt;/a&gt; etc. without entering the keys password again. Apparently Sshkeychain has a preference setting that secures the Mac's key chain after some idle time in order to keep your keys secure. After unchecking this option the key chain never got locked by itself. I hope this little hint is useful to someone. If so please leave a comment! Have a great day!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My name is Torsten Uhlmann, I’m founder of &lt;a href='http://www.agynamix.de/'&gt;AGYNAMIX&lt;/a&gt;, a tiny (sooo tiiiny its just me) software company specializing in Java software consulting for larger corporations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I also develop &lt;a href='http://www.simidude.com/'&gt;Simidude&lt;/a&gt;, an easy to use cross platform network clipboard and Drag &amp; Drop tool which you might happen to find useful.&lt;/p&gt;

Earn Money by Selling Simidude
</title>
<description>
&lt;p&gt;Now you can even make money with &lt;a href='http://www.simidude.com'&gt;Simidude&lt;/a&gt;! I have partnered with &lt;a href='http://www.shareasale.com'&gt;ShareASale.com&lt;/a&gt; to find new ways to bring Simidude to the people. ShareASale is a well respected affiliate system that connects affiliates and product vendors. So if you would like to earn some money by spreading the word about Simidude you can &lt;a href='http://www.shareasale.com/shareasale.cfm?merchantID=21879'&gt;apply here&lt;/a&gt;. You will go through a registration process with ShareASale. After they have accepted your application (this is to make sure that no one gets betrayed) you can start advertising and selling Simidude through your website. I'm in the process of creating banners and other graphics that will aid you in the process- these will all be available through the ShareASale site. To promote the software you could write reviews on your website and link to Simidude through the links provided by ShareASale to make sure you get your &quot;share form the sale&quot; (nice pun, eh). Again, here is the &lt;a href='http://http://www.shareasale.com/shareasale.cfm?merchantID=21879'&gt;link to apply as my affiliate&lt;/a&gt;. Thanks for your interest, Torsten.&lt;/p&gt;

Simidude now costs just 25 bucks
</title>
<description>
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/uploads/2009/04/daniel_und_blumen21.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt; I'd like to announce a substantial price drop for the Simidude application. Simidude will from now on be available for just USD 25 or 20 Euro. Due to the exchange rate between Euro and USD the previous USD I felt the price was too high. Considering the fact that most purchases come from within the United States I adjusted the price accordingly. In the last few weeks I received a lot of great comments about Simidude like this one:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dealCommentName&quot;&gt;&quot;Patrick J. Says:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Hi Torsten, just ordered it, a big thanks for this very useful product! As Alexander D. said, the 'one license per cluster' scheme is very kind. Please keep on the good work. &quot;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'm thankful for all encouraging words and helpful suggestions! Currently I'm working on an exciting next release which will be free to existing customers. In this release I will polish some of the remaining rough edges. I also will implement a small web server embedded into Simidude. This will allow you to access you clipboard's content or files and folders that you have dragged unto Simidude directly from your web browser. This is useful if you don't want or cannot install an extra Simidude on one of the machines... Feel free to &lt;a href='http://www.simidude.com/download/'&gt;download Simidude&lt;/a&gt; and try it for free for 30 days. I also won't stop you &lt;a href='http://www.simidude.com/order/'&gt;buying Simidude right away&lt;/a&gt;. Have a great day!&lt;/p&gt;

Jira and Confluence $5 each (for the next 5 days)
</title>
<description>
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href='http://twitter.com/balsamiq'&gt;Balsamiq&lt;/a&gt; twittered it first and I'd like to repeat this great offer of Atlassian here: Until Friday, April 24 you can get Jira And Confluence for a price of $5 each for five users. Don't nail me down on the specific time though- Atlassian is to my knowledge an Australian company and I don't know which time zone they use for there offer... Jira is a Java-based Enterprise grade bug tracking system, and Confluence is an Enterprise wiki with every feature in it you could dream of but where afraid to ask. So if you are a startup you may want to take advantage of this great offer: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.atlassian.com/starter/&quot;&gt;http://www.atlassian.com/starter/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

A simple and free MP3 Tag Editor
</title>
<description>
&lt;p&gt;I had some code laying around on my hard disk and thought it might be a good idea to clean it up and release it- so maybe this one is of help for others. I once had a need for a simple MP3 tag editor that I could throw a podcast file upon and have an easy way to change it's essential tags. It's a pretty easy tool, it comes with an easy to use installer. Just install, open it, choose a file, edit the tags, save the file and done. Nothing fancy, just useful :) Here's a screenshot of the thing: &lt;a href='/img/uploads/2009/03/taginspector.jpg'&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://blog.agynamix.de/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/taginspector-300x241.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title= &quot;TagInspector Screenshot&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Please note that TagInspector only runs on Windows and requires the .Net framework. I did this as a learning project to do something practically with C&amp;#35;- before I put the books back in the shelf. Ah, right, here is the &lt;a href='http://cms.agynamix.de/downloads/cat_view-2.html'&gt;download URL&lt;/a&gt;. While you're there you might want to check for other cool software, both free and commercial that I do offer... Have a great day, Torsten.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My name is Torsten Uhlmann, I’m founder of &lt;a href='http://www.agynamix.de/'&gt;AGYNAMIX&lt;/a&gt;, a tiny (sooo tiiiny its just me) software company specializing in Java software consulting for larger corporations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I also develop &lt;a href='http://www.simidude.com/'&gt;Simidude&lt;/a&gt;, a cross platform network clipboard and Drag&amp;Drop tool which you might happen to find useful.&lt;/p&gt;

Mac Security- Another Way to Lock Your Mac Screen
</title>
<description>
&lt;p&gt;When using your Mac in a busy environment it might be important to shield it against unauthorized access. If you leave your desk to head for that donut of yours or to dispose of the many coffee you drank you may not want to leave your machine unattended. There are two simple settings that will prevend any unauthorized access to your Mac:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;1- Require a password when your Mac starts up&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the Mac starts it usually shows your desktop right away. This is convinient but also very insecure- especially if you leave your box unattended. Do the following to make OS X behave more appropriate:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Start your settings dialog and open &quot;user settings&quot;&lt;a href='/img/uploads/2009/03/benutzer.jpg'&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/uploads/2009/03/benutzer.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title= &quot;benutzer&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Click on &quot;Login Settings&quot; (you may need to unlock that screen by clicking on the lock in the left corner of that screen&quot;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Choose &quot;Automatic Login deactivated&quot;&lt;a href='/img/uploads/2009/03/benutzer-auto-login.jpg'&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/uploads/2009/03/benutzer-auto-login.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title= &quot;benutzer-auto-login&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lock the screen and close.&lt;h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;2- Lock your screen when you're away&lt;p&gt;I found two possible ways to lock the screen of my Mac. There first one is to enable &quot;quickly change user&quot;. You can set this up on the same screen as &quot;Automatic Login deactivated&quot;. You can set it up to display a small user icon in the menu bar. When you click on it you get the option to change to the login window which effectively asks for your password before it would let you see your desktop again. Unfortunately this one also separates UMTS connections and possibly other things. Another way is to go through your keychain manager:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Open the keychain manager&lt;a href='/img/uploads/2009/03/dienstprogramme.jpg'&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/uploads/2009/03/dienstprogramme.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title= &quot;dienstprogramme&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Choose settings and enable &quot;Show status in menu bar&quot;&lt;a href='/img/uploads/2009/03/einstellungen.jpg'&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/uploads/2009/03/einstellungen.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title= &quot;einstellungen&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This will show you a little lock symbol in the menu bar. Clicking it gives you the option to lock your screen. You need to enter your password to get back to your desktop. I like this option better- it looks more appealing and doesn't seem to separate any connections.&lt;a href='/img/uploads/2009/03/lock_screen.jpg'&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/uploads/2009/03/lock_screen.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title= &quot;lock_screen&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do you know any other security tips? Let me and others know be commenting here! Have a great day!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My name is Torsten Uhlmann, I’m founder of &lt;a href='http://www.agynamix.de/'&gt;AGYNAMIX&lt;/a&gt;, a tiny (sooo tiiiny its just me) software company specializing in Java software consulting for larger corporations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I also develop &lt;a href='http://www.simidude.com/'&gt;Simidude&lt;/a&gt;, a cross platform network clipboard and Drag&amp;Drop tool which you might happen to find useful.&lt;/p&gt;

How you can add GPS information to your digital photos
</title>
<description>
&lt;p&gt;One of the great waves of the last years is geotagging, meaning you keep track of the locations you have been with the means of a GPS tracker and than be able to create a map that shows the waypoint of your last trip. Of course geotagging is more but for the course of this article it generically means to tag something with GPS information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href='/img/uploads/2009/03/gps_tagged_photo.jpg'&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://blog.agynamix.de/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/gps_tagged_photo-300x299.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lately I thought of a way to tag my digital photos with GPS information. Recent SLR cameras may come with a build in GPS but my Canon 400D is just 2 years old and I don't wont to buy a new one just because of this. A few days ago I figured out a pretty convenient way to record the location of where I am and later put this information into my photos. This procedure works under the assumption that both your GPS logger and your digital camera use nearly the same clock settings. &lt;strong&gt;Theory:&lt;/strong&gt; The GPS logger records our present location every, say, 30 seconds. At home when you upload your photos to your camera you need a software that will look up the time code in your photo and then use that time code to look up a recording of a GPS location that was made to a close point in time. If no recording is found (say one minute before and after the time code of the photo) then no location information is added. &lt;strong&gt;Let's get to work:&lt;/strong&gt; I found the following components best to work with:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;I use my Nokia E71 handy with integrated GPS chip as the logger. Whenever I shoot photos I start the logger (see below) and let it run in the background. You may use another GPS handy or even a specialized GPS logger. The system is pretty flexible and does work with a great number of components.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;As a GPS logging software on my E71 I use &lt;a href='http://linuxtechs.net/kruch/tb/forum/index.php'&gt;TrekBuddy&lt;/a&gt;. TrekBuddy is a free Java based tracking software. It does a lot more things like showing your present location on a map but I just use it to record my GPS location. The setup of the software is described on the Website. &lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt; It is important that you enable Tracklog logging. To do this go to &lt;em&gt;Settings-&amp;gt;Location&lt;/em&gt; and set Tracklog to &quot;always&quot;. Below that you can change the interval a log entry is written. I have changed mine to 30s. After running the software it will create a folder TrekBuddy/tracks-gpx either on your phones card or internal memory, that depends on your device. That directory contains GPX files, one for each run of the software. Download these files to your computer.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A camera. Of course. You can use any brand you want, as long as it writes a time tag into your photos- which to my knowledge all cameras do. I use JPG to archive my photos. You can also use the RAW format. The software I use to merge GPS location into my photos supports some RAW formats (see below).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A software to merge GPS location information into your photos. For this I have found &lt;a href='http://code.google.com/p/gpicsync/'&gt;GPicSync&lt;/a&gt;. GPicSync is a free software that takes a GPX file and a folder with to be tagged images and merges the two together. Please see &lt;a href='http://code.google.com/p/gpicsync/wiki/RawFormats'&gt;this site&lt;/a&gt; if your RAW format is supported. Now, what if you have multiple GPX files to tag your photos with (for instance, one for each day): The only way I have found to handle this is to synchronize that image folder with each GPX file subsequentially. If a time stamp does not match between image and GPX entry then the image is not changed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;After that you can import your photos into your photo software. I use iPhoto 2009 which shows me the location of the photo when I click on the little &quot;i&quot;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have found that procedure to work and be pretty unobtrusive. Switching on the GPS logger on my handy is pretty easy and can run in background. Then the only additional steps are to download the GPX files from my handy (I do this through Bluetooth) and synchronize my photos via GPicSync. I can also no longer just upload my photos with iPhoto. Instead I use Image Capture which comes with my Mac to upload the camera's photos into a temp folder. After the sync I import them into iPhoto. I don't know about you but I really like knowing where I shot a photo even after a long period of time. What do you think about the process? We are now open to take comments!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My name is Torsten Uhlmann, I’m founder of &lt;a href='http://www.agynamix.de/'&gt;AGYNAMIX&lt;/a&gt;, a tiny (sooo tiiiny its just me) software company specializing in Java software consulting for larger corporations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I also develop &lt;a href='http://www.simidude.com/'&gt;Simidude&lt;/a&gt;, a cross platform network clipboard and Drag&amp;Drop tool which you might happen to find useful.&lt;/p&gt;

I'm a Twitterer now- finally
</title>
<description>
&lt;p&gt;After reading much about &lt;a href='http://twitter.com/agynamix'&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; and wondering if I might want to join this thing I decided a few days ago that I want to and then actually did. I am in the process of figuring out how to use it effectively and how to provide the most value to my followers. Speaking of which- let me invite you to &lt;a href='http://twitter.com/agynamix'&gt;follow me on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;. I think I was most compelled to think about the Twitter value when reading a &lt;a href='http://www.balsamiq.com/blog/?p=198'&gt;marketing article&lt;/a&gt;on &lt;a href='http://www.balsamiq.com/'&gt;Peldi's blog&lt;/a&gt;. Well if you want to sell online products I guess you have to use online marketing techniques, right? And one of these is blogging- writing about things and giving free value to your readership. Twitter is like a micro blog- but more so it's a way to communicate with a group of people. You know, we got our first telephone (landline to my parents home) in 1995. Before that I had to go to a public phone and shell out amounts of money to call my friends. See how much the world changed? Nowadays I use &lt;a href='http://www.skype.com'&gt;Skype&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href='http://www.xing.com/profile/Torsten_Uhlmann2'&gt;Xing&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href='http://blog.agynamix.de'&gt;my blog&lt;/a&gt;, and now &lt;a href='http://twitter.com/agynamix'&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; to communicate. For a lot less money to a lot more people. I like technology...&lt;/p&gt;

First Simidude Review
</title>
<description>
&lt;p&gt;A few days ago my new software Simidude received its first review. The german blogger tAXMAN Tom was running a post about network clipboards- actually the perfect situation Simidude is made for. I wrote a comment to this post and invited Tom to give Simidude a try which he did.Shortly after that his blog conceived a [new post about Simidude](http://www.taxmantom.de/simidude &quot;Simidude Review&quot;) in rather enthusiastic words. The bottom line of his post: &quot;For me Simidude is exactly what I've been looking for&quot; (translated from german). ![](/img/uploads/2009/02/plants.jpg) If you are a blogger I would like to offer you a free license of Simidude. Just write me an email with a link to your blog- I will unconditionally send you a license back. If you do use Simidude please consider writing a review in your blog... On a personal matter: Tomorrow night my family and I will start into one week of hysterically longed for holiday. I will read my emails but my response time might be longer than an hour. I though do try to read me email every day... So you to have a great week!&lt;/p&gt;

Simidude 1.2.0 released
</title>
<description>
&lt;p&gt;I'm pretty excited to finally release version 1.2.0 of &lt;a href='http://www.simidude.com'&gt;AGYNAMIX Simidude&lt;/a&gt;. Based on the feedback of customers and testers I have implemented some exciting new features:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clipboard entries can now be saved to disk&lt;/strong&gt;: With a right click on the item in the clipboard table you get a new menu entry &quot;Save as...&quot;. Every type of clipboard entry, even clipboard images, can saved to disk this way! For images, just choose the extension &quot;jpg&quot;, &quot;png&quot; or &quot;bmp&quot; to save the image in the corresponding format. &lt;strong&gt;Simidude is now an easy way to copy part of an image and save it to disk!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Activate item in default application&lt;/strong&gt;: Choosing this menu entry from the context menu will open the clipboard entry with the registered default application. Clipboard images will be saved as &quot;jpg&quot; files and Text as &quot;txt&quot; files and open by the registered application. Contents of remote files or directories is downloaded prior to opening them. BTW, Simidude automatically recognizes an URL within a Clipboard text and will open the URL in the default browser when you double click on it or press enter when the entry is highlighted.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Easily create a text entry&lt;/strong&gt;: Simidude now contains a simple text dialog that you can use to write some text directly into Simidude.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Remove entries from all connected clients&lt;/strong&gt;: There are now menu entries to clear the clipboard table on all connected clients, or only the selected entry. Pressing the &quot;Shift&quot; key along with the two remove buttons in the toolbar has the same effect. The &quot;Shift&quot; modifier changes the remove action from just altering the local client to effecting all connected clients.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New keyboard shortcuts&lt;/strong&gt;: I've introduced some keyboard shortcuts to access Simidude's features more easily. For instance you could press &quot;Del&quot; or &quot;Backspace&quot; to delete an entry. Using the &quot;Shift&quot; modifier works here, too. Pressing &quot;Enter&quot; the selected entry will be opened in it's default application.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update checker can be disabled&lt;/strong&gt;: In the preferences you can now set when you want the Update checker to run. This can be &quot;Never&quot;, &quot;Once a week&quot; or &quot;On every start&quot;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Of course I also fixed a bunch of bugs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Please go ahead and &lt;a href='http://www.simidude.com/download'&gt;download&lt;/a&gt; the new version. You can order &lt;a href='http://www.simidude.com'&gt;Simidude&lt;/a&gt; for just €26 from our &lt;a href='http://www.simidude.com/order'&gt;order page&lt;/a&gt;. You only need to pay once for any number of connected clients! If you have questions, ideas or comments please drop &lt;a href='http://helpdesk.agynamix.de/index.php?pg=request'&gt;me a note&lt;/a&gt;. Enjoy, Torsten.&lt;/p&gt;

Use your Novatel Ovation MC950D with Linux
</title>
<description>
&lt;p&gt;A while back I bought myself a Vodafone &lt;a href='http://www.moobicent.de/'&gt;UMTS flat rate&lt;/a&gt; together with one of thise nifty UMTS USB sticks. Mine is a Novatel Ovation MC950D.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/uploads/2009/01/thalheim_im_winter.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Windows, there isn't much to bother. The stick comes with the Mobile Connect Lite software installed in the memory part. These kinds of USB devices act as a memory stick when not activated otherwise or as an UMTS modem. So the first time you connect the stick it will connect as a memory stick and show you a directory with the setup files for the Mobile Connect drivers. Install them and the next time (you might need to reboot) you connect the stick it will reconnect as an UMTS modem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's the way it works on Windows XP. On my Vista machine, it doesn't automatically reconnect. I have to start the &quot;LiteAuto.exe&quot; application fom the stick manually. After that it works as expected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now for my travels I have bought this little beautiful MSI Wind Netbook. It comes preinstalled with Windows XP. Being me I created a dual boot setup with Windows XP in one partition and Ubuntu 8.10 in the other. BTW, &lt;a href='http://wiki.msiwind.net/index.php/Ubuntu_8.04_Tweaks'&gt;this site&lt;/a&gt; describes some tweaks you should engage in in order to get your MSI Window running fully under Ubuntu. I for instance exchanged the installed WLan card or an &quot; &lt;a href='http://support.intel.com/support/wireless/wlan/pro3945abg/ &quot;http://support.intel.com/support/wireless/wlan/pro3945abg/&quot;'&gt;Intel PRO/Wireless 3945ABG&lt;/a&gt;&quot; in order to make use of WiFi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now I also wanted to use my UMTS modem when working with Ubuntu. The first (semi successful) attempt I made was by following the description in &lt;a href='http://quilombo.wordpress.com/2008/01/21/modem-usb-35g-novatel-ovation-mc950d-in-ubuntulinux/'&gt;this blog post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It worked, but I found it dreadfull to call some command line script in order to reconnect the stick as a modem. So I set it up as an exercise but didn't really use it much.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now these last days a ran across a site caled &lt;a href='http://www.betavine.net/bvportal/web/linux_drivers'&gt;Betavine&lt;/a&gt;, a Vodafone research and community site where they publish, among others, UMTS card drivers for Linux.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I downloaded the &quot;&lt;a href='https://forge.betavine.net/frs/download.php/269/vodafone-mobile-connect-card-driver-for-linux-2.0.beta3-ALL-i386-installer.run'&gt;Autoinstall for Ubuntu Fedore SuSE&lt;/a&gt;&quot; file, installed it:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;sudo .vodafone-mobile-connect-card-driver-for-linux-2.0.beta3-ALL-i386-installer.run
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;and, after a reboot of my machine it just worked!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I inserted the Novatel stick and, after the stick had powered up, it would show a new entry in Ubuntu's Network Manager (you access it from the little icon in the upper panel). When you click on the network Manager icon you see a new Network &quot;Vodafone D2&quot; (or whatever network you are in), you can click on it and it will connect. Mighty cool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now I just need to get that stick working with my Mac...&lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My name is Torsten Uhlmann, I'm founder of &lt;a href='http://www.agynamix.de'&gt;AGYNAMIX&lt;/a&gt;, a tiny (sooo tiiiny its just me) software company specializing in Java software consulting for larger corporations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I also develop &lt;a href='http://www.simidude.com'&gt;Simidude&lt;/a&gt;, a cross platform network clipboard and Drag&amp;Drop tool which you might happen to find usefull.&lt;/p&gt;

Simidude 1.1.0 released
</title>
<description>
&lt;p&gt;Today I released version 1.1.0 of &lt;a href='http://www.simidude.com'&gt;AGYNAMIX Simidude&lt;/a&gt;. This new release comes along with a load of new features that just were not ready for version 1 but are now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;new&amp;#95;features&amp;#95;of&amp;#95;&lt;a href='http://www.simidude.com'&gt;Simidude&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#95;1.1.0:&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;New Features of &lt;a href='http://www.simidude.com'&gt;Simidude&lt;/a&gt; 1.1.0:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Automatic Updates&lt;/strong&gt;: Simidude now automatically checks if new updates are available. In such a case you'll get notified and asked if you'd download the new release.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Thumbnails:&lt;/strong&gt; if you drag an image onto Simidude or copy the path of an image to the clipboard, Simidude will show a thumbnail view of the image so that you can visually distinguish Simidude entries much better. Please note that a thumbnail will not be created if the image is too large (over 2 Mio. bytes).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Copy Images from Clipboard:&lt;/strong&gt; If you copy an image to the clipboard it is now processed by Simidude. Simidude will show a thumbnail view of the copied image as well as its pixel size. The image will be sent to all connected clients and can from there be dragged onto a target application or copied into the clipboard of the target machine.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Double Click on Files:&lt;/strong&gt; Double clicking on a file now tries to open the application registered for this file type. If the content of this file has not yet been retrieved from the source client this will be done prior to launching the registered application.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Double Click on Urls:&lt;/strong&gt; Double clicking on text that is recognized as an Url now opens the standard browser with that Url. It is now even easier to copy a Url to the clipboard on one machine and open it by simply double clicking on it on another machine.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Filtering of Simidude Entries&lt;/strong&gt;: In the upper right corner of the main Simidude window there is now a little search box. Type some text there and after hitting &quot;Enter&quot; only entries that contain this text will be displayed. This will make it easier for you to sift through a larger number of entries.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Buttons to remove on or all entries&lt;/strong&gt;: To make using Simidude more comfortable there are now menu entries and toolbar button to remove the currently selected entry or to clear the whole list. The currently selected entry can also be removed by hitting the &quot;Del&quot; or &quot;Backspace&quot; key.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Better Mac OS X integration&lt;/strong&gt;: Simidude now supports the standard OS X application menu with entries like &quot;About&quot;, &quot;Preferences&quot; and &quot;Quit&quot;. Simidude now comes with a proper Macintosh-Icon now that does not feature that ugly scaling artifacts as the previous one did.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am very pleased with the current version. I would encourage you to &lt;a href='http://www.simidude.com/download'&gt;download our free 30-day trial&lt;/a&gt; version and test it.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>
Macify a SWT application in a cross platform way
</title>
<description>
&lt;p&gt;For the next release of Simidude I wanted a deeper integration into the supported platforms, specifically Mac OS X. There are some sites on the web that point out an integration of Swing into OS X but rather few for the SWT toolkit which I use. On such very helpful site is &lt;a href='http://www.cafeaulait.org/slides/eclipseworld2005/macifying/Macifying_SWT.html'&gt;this on&lt;/a&gt;. It leads to an implementation of CarbonUIEnhancer as described in &lt;a href='http://www.azureuswiki.com/index.php/PreferencesAndAbout'&gt;the Azureus wiki&lt;/a&gt; that uses internal API to access the Macintosh application menu and plant &quot;About&quot; and &quot;Preferences&quot; menu entries. However the drawback with this solution is that it is hard coded against carbon internals. That means it either only is compilable with the carbon jar in your class path or you need to have some stub implementation of the carbon api and swap both depending on the platform you'll be running on. &lt;a href='/img/uploads/2008/12/simidude_110.jpg &quot;A Preview of Simidude 1.1.0&quot;'&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/uploads/2008/12/simidude_110_100px.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; In addition there is the &quot;Quit&quot; menu entry in the OS X application menu that should work accordingly. In the following article I'd like to explain my approach to macifying Simidude. First thing you would need to do is to conditionally exclude the 3 (&quot;Quit&quot;, &quot;About&quot;, &quot;Preferences&quot;) menu entries. I use a method PlatformUtil.isMacOS() to determine if the application run on OS X. The method basically the two system properties &quot;os.name&quot; and &quot;os.arch&quot; to find out the platform it runs on. For Mac it checks against &quot;os.name=='Mac OS X'&quot; and &quot;os.arch=='i386'&quot;. So when you build your menu you would have to program something like this for all three menu entries: &amp;#91;sourcecode language='java'&amp;#93; if (!PlatformUtils.isMacOs()) { filemenu.add(new Separator()); filemenu.add(exitAction); } &amp;#91;/sourcecode&amp;#93; To hook your application into the &quot;Quit&quot; menu entry you have to add an SWT listener like so: &amp;#91;sourcecode language='java'&amp;#93; display.addListener(SWT.Close, new Listener() { public void handleEvent(Event event) { shutdownApplication(); // could veto // event.doit = false; } }); &amp;#91;/sourcecode&amp;#93; Now to the CarbonUIEnhancer. I started with the code from the Azureus wiki and transformed it the way it only uses reflection to access the carbon api. So it still does the same thing but without compile time dependencies upon carbon. Somewhere in your code you have to instantiate it like so: &amp;#91;sourcecode language='java'&amp;#93; if (PlatformUtils.isMacOs()) { try { CarbonUIEnhancer carbonUI = new CarbonUIEnhancer(&quot;About &quot;+ApplicationInfo.getApplicationName()); carbonUI.hookApplicationMenu(getShell().getDisplay(), new Listener() { public void handleEvent(Event event) { shutdownApplicationGui(); // could veto // event.doit = false; } }, aboutAction, preferencesAction); } catch (Exception e) { // handle exception } } &amp;#91;/sourcecode&amp;#93; I have changed the &quot;hookApplicationMenu&quot; method call. It now takes IAction's as parameters as well as the SWT listener that will listen to the Close event. I have uploaded the source code here: &lt;a href='/img/uploads/2008/12/carbonuienhancer.zip'&gt;CarbonUIEnhancer.zip&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Simidude Version 1.0.0 released
</title>
<description>
&lt;p&gt;Today I'd like to announce, after much sweat, the release of Simidude 1.0.0. &lt;a href='/img/uploads/2008/11/screenshot_vista1.jpg'&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/uploads/2008/11/screenshot_vista-300x199.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title= &quot;screenshot_vista&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Simidude is an easy to use cross platform Drag&amp;Drop and clipboard synchronization tool. During the last weeks I have cleaned up the code and made the program easier to use and to install (I hope). Simidude clients now install pretty much hassle free- if you have computers whitin the same subnet (which usually is the case for small companies or home networks) the clients connect to each other automatically. If you put something in one computers clipboard it will be synchronized to all other connected clients. From there you can activate the item on the target machine and paste it to where it should go. I had the original idea for this application while surfing the net on my developer machine, looking for information how to setup a certain thing. When I found what I needed I searched for a way to transport the URL between those machines. I found several options:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;USB stick&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;email the link&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;network share&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;While all of the alternatives above do work they are not really smooth. In addition to this I sometimes work with virtual machines where I do not setup a shared folder or I do not have a network share available. Now Simidude solves the above problems. I install it on all the systems I want to hook together, enter a group name and a password and Simidude starts looking for other instances. When it found other clients it exchanges information with them. So if you already have information in one instance it will eventually travel to all connected clients. If you have similar problems then please don't hessitate and drive over to the &lt;a href='http://www.simidude.com/download'&gt;Simidude download site&lt;/a&gt; and grab a trial version yourself. Simidude is available for an introductory price of €25,95 for Windows Vista and XP, Mac OS X (Tiger and Leopard) and Linux. Please not that there might still be some rough edges in the application. Please report any missing features or bugs at our &lt;a href='http://helpdesk.agynamix.de'&gt;helpdesk&lt;/a&gt;. A version 1 license will be valid for all version 1 updates, so you don't loose money if you buy early. On the contrary, you will benefit from our introductory price and our polite support. Thanks for reading this far! Have a nice day, Torsten Uhlmann, Founder&lt;/p&gt;

Wordpress 2.6, safe_mode and file uploads
</title>
<description>
&lt;p&gt;Since I'm (most of the time) a responsible internet user I try to keep my web applications up to date.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href='http://blog.agynamix.de/blog/2008/keep-wordpress-up-to-date-with-subversion/'&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt; I describe how you can keep Wordpress up to date with updates directly from the source. Now I've done that for this blog and my new &lt;a href='http://www.simidude.com'&gt;Simidude website&lt;/a&gt;. All went well, software got updated and I got a good feeling knowing I did something for peace on the internet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now these days I wanted to write some new articles including some charming images. Images in posts are great because the just make the post more pleasant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So I cheerfully wrote some text about our &lt;a href='http://www.simidude.com/blog/2008/simidude-screenshots/'&gt;new baby boy &quot;Sim&quot;&lt;/a&gt; whom I like to call Simi dude and I also wanted to include some screenshots about how he looks by now so that, in a few weeks or so, people would see how fast he has grown and become a real boy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hm, suddenly Wordpress bombards me with the following error message while I was trying to upload a foto:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt; Unable to create directory &quot;&amp;#91;...&amp;#93;/uploads/2008/11&quot;. Is its parent directory writeable by server? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course it is writable! And sure enough it worked a few weeks ago. (well actually month- the last time I uploaded an image into this blog was in May. I'm ashamed.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since I'm running a real root server with ssh access I went to the server and toyed with the Unix file permissions. So I tried setting the wp-content directory world-writable (777). No effect, same error message. FYI I changed the settings back- no need to hack the server...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then I realized the following:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href='/img/uploads/2008/11/linstow_006.jpg'&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://blog.agynamix.de/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/linstow_006-224x300.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title= &quot;linstow_006&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The uploads directory was owned by web4.www-data. web4 is my user account on the machine, www-data is the user and group of the Apache server (standard on Debian based systems).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A directory &quot;2008&quot; was actually created with the owner &quot;www-data.www-data&quot; because it had been created by the Apache server through the PHP script. Just the &quot;11&quot; directory could not be created. So I did this by hand, setting ownership to www-data.www-data. Now I rushed over to the upload dialog being pretty sure it would work now. No luck! Still I received an error message (see above) that this directory could not be created.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After spending some time with my friend Google and reading helpless posts that sugessted setting the file permissions to 777 and don't care about the rest I came across some explanation of PHP safe&amp;#95;mode (did I mention I use safe&amp;#95;mode on)?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What matters here is that safe&amp;#95;mode checks if the executed script belongs to the same owner as the directory it writes into. Now my Wordpress installation belongs to web4.www-data so that I could use FTP or SSH to connect as user web4 and actually have write permission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So the script that uploads the image tries to create the directory &quot;2008&quot;. That works because the parent directory, &quot;uploads&quot;, belong to web4.www-data. But the created directory &quot;2008&quot; is now owned by www-data.www-data because it was created by the Apache server. When it tries to create &quot;11&quot; inside &quot;2008&quot; it fails miserably because &quot;2008&quot; is not owned by web4.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After creating the directory &quot;11&quot; by hand and changing the ownership of &quot;2008&quot; and &quot;11&quot; to web4.www-data I was able to upload images!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now for a somewhat permanent solution because I don't want to go to my server each month and create a new directory by hand:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apparently there is a setting in php.ini which tells the safe&amp;#95;mode to not just look at the owner of a file but also the goup of it. The setting is called:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;strong&gt;safe&amp;#95;mode&amp;#95;gid = On&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was Off in my case. After changing it and restarting Apache I could readily create directories and upload images.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now if you can't change that setting because you don't have root access it might also work if you can change the ownership of your Wordpress php files to www-data.www-data. Because after you've done that the user of the script and of the created directory would match again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hope this saves some of your time!&lt;/p&gt;

Simidude Screenshots
</title>
<description>
&lt;p&gt;I had some slight problems with my Wordpress installation that prevented me from uploading files. Since I corrected the problems now I'd like to present the first screenshots of Simidude. To not offend any particular platform or their followersI will present the screenshots in alphabetic order :) :&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Mac OS X:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#91;caption id=&quot;attachment&amp;#95;68&quot; align=&quot;alignnone&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; caption=&quot;Simidude on Mac OS X 10.5&quot;&amp;#93;&lt;a href='/img/uploads/2008/11/screenshot_mac1.jpg'&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/uploads/2008/11/screenshot_mac-300x228.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Simidude on Mac OS X 10.5&quot; title= &quot;screenshot_mac&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#91;/caption&amp;#93;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;MS Windows Vista:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#91;caption id=&quot;attachment&amp;#95;69&quot; align=&quot;alignnone&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; caption=&quot;Simidude on Vista&quot;&amp;#93;&lt;a href='/img/uploads/2008/11/screenshot_vista1.jpg'&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/uploads/2008/11/screenshot_vista-300x199.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Simidude on Vista&quot; title= &quot;screenshot_vista&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#91;/caption&amp;#93;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Ubuntu Linux 8.10:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#91;caption id=&quot;attachment&amp;#95;70&quot; align=&quot;alignnone&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; caption=&quot;Simidude on Ubuntu&quot;&amp;#93;&lt;a href='/img/uploads/2008/11/screenshot_linux1.png'&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/uploads/2008/11/screenshot_linux-300x198.png&quot; alt=&quot;Simidude on Ubuntu&quot; title= &quot;screenshot_linux&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#91;/caption&amp;#93; Now Simidude still feels pretty rough around its virtual edges but it's already pretty usable. I hope to post a first beta version before the end of November. I restrain myself from adding new features. Instead I'm gonna make the available features more robust and the whole thing easier to use. In a Simidude network one of the installations acts as a server. This server will accept connections from other Simidude clients and will coordinate the traffic from one client to another. Apart from that the server is nothing special. I choose this setup to be able to connect clients which are in different subnets, for instance a virtual machine that runs through a NAT network connection. The NAT will give the VM their own address realm. Using peer-to-peer here would only work if you had a relay kind of server that would initiate the connection between two Simidude installations. So instead I choose to let one installation play the part of the server. The user has to tell Simidude through its preferences whether it should act as a server or as a client. When acting as a server Simidude can self detect it's current network address and use it to listen for incoming requests. When acting as a client however the user has to give it the server's address so the client can setup a connection. I want to make this part easier. I might use a network broadcast to find out if there is a server somewhere in the same subnet listening and automatically set the found network address. That should work in most cases. People who use NAT networks know how to set an IP address anyway :) So if you are interested in this kind of application please let me know what kind of features you'd expect.&lt;/p&gt;

Simidude logo
</title>
<description>
&lt;p&gt;You don't believe all the steps involved in creating an application! One of those things you forget most easily is having a logo for your aplication. Something your app is identified with. Now since my artistic skills are rather underexposed I wisely decided to hire someone to create a logo. Thankfully the guys at &lt;a href='http://discuss.joelonsoftware.com/default.asp?biz'&gt;BOS&lt;/a&gt; discussed this matter in a &lt;a href='http://discuss.joelonsoftware.com/default.asp?biz.5.690389.10'&gt;recent thread&lt;/a&gt; so all I had to do was to check out the mentioned and recommended artists. I ended up with &lt;a href='http://www.ars-logo-design.com/'&gt;Arslogodesign&lt;/a&gt; and I'm very pleased so far. At first contact you basically fill out some briefing information that tells them about your company/product, your ideas etc. They then develop 5 drafts for you from which you can choose one which in multiple steps would be refined afterwards. Here are these 5 logos: &lt;a href='/img/uploads/2008/11/logo_1.jpg'&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/uploads/2008/11/logo_1-300x150.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title= &quot;logo_1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href='/img/uploads/2008/11/logo_2.jpg'&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/uploads/2008/11/logo_2-300x150.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title= &quot;logo_2&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href='/img/uploads/2008/11/logo_3.jpg'&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/uploads/2008/11/logo_3-300x150.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title= &quot;logo_3&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href='/img/uploads/2008/11/logo_4.jpg'&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/uploads/2008/11/logo_4-300x150.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title= &quot;logo_4&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href='/img/uploads/2008/11/logo_5.jpg'&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/uploads/2008/11/logo_5-300x150.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title= &quot;logo_5&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; After some discussion we settled on the first version. I feel it represents the nature of the application quiet well. Another side effect is that I can use the joint squares as theme for an application icon. Oh well, an application icon is the next thing I need to get done...&lt;/p&gt;

Initialize SWT Action accelerators in SWT 3.4
</title>
<description>
&lt;p&gt;While developing my new application &lt;a href='http://www.simidude.com'&gt;Simidude&lt;/a&gt; I ran about a funny problem with JFace's MenuManager. I develop Simidude (an easy to use cross platform clipboard synchronizer and Drag &amp; Drop tool- it's exciting, &lt;a href='http://www.simidude.com'&gt;you should look at it&lt;/a&gt; :)) using Java 5 and the SWT/JFace libraries from &lt;a href='http://www.eclipse.org'&gt;Eclipse&lt;/a&gt;. SWT provides Java with a platform specific look and feel which makes my application appear native on all supported (Windows, Mac and Linux) platforms. Because I want the application to be small and carry as little overhead as possible I do not use the Eclipse RCP platform but rather just the GUI libraries. Now when writing a JFace application you subclass ApplicationWindow for your application's main window. To create a menu bar you overwrite the method &quot;MenuMnager createMenuManager()&quot; in which you create your top level menu items like &quot;File&quot;, &quot;Edit&quot; or &quot;Help&quot; as well as the Actions that you plug into them. An Action basically wraps up the information needed to display a menu entry as well as some code to do something. Actions can be reused to be shown in the menubar as well as in the toolbar. An Action can hold for instance an image object, a tooltip text or an accelerator definition. To set an accelerator for my &quot;Quit&quot; action I'd do something like this:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt; setAccelerator(SWT.MOD1 + 'Q'); &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;SWT.MOD1&quot; is replaced with the platform specific modifier like &quot;CTRL&quot; on Windows and Linux and &quot;Command&quot; (Apple key) on Mac. Now one would expect that you could actually USE this key combination in a running application. Far from it. I had to click on the menu with the mouse, then do something in the application and then the keys would work. Sounds like an initialization problem. So I filed a bug with Eclipse. Turned out they had &quot;optimized&quot; the menu creation code in Eclipse 3.4 which would actually cause this pain. Btw it works fine if you're in an Eclipse plugin or RCP applications. And it also works if you're using plain SWT and are not using Actions but creating the menu entries the SWT style. Turns out this is some weird JFace initialization thing. But the good news is there is a workaround: After creating your menubar you need to &lt;strong&gt;initialize&lt;/strong&gt; it. This is my initialization routine which is called in the beginning of the life cycle:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt; public void initializeApplicationGUI() { makeActions(); addMenuBar(); addToolBar(SWT.TOP | SWT.FLAT | SWT.HORIZONTAL | SWT.SHADOW&amp;#95;OUT ); addStatusLine(); &lt;strong&gt;create(); getMenuBarManager().updateAll(true);&lt;/strong&gt; } &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you add the last two lines suddenly your menu flies. I don't know how long I digged around for such a stupid bug... Anyway I hope I could save some of your time!&lt;/p&gt;

Simidude- Easy to use cross platform drag &amp; drop
</title>
<description>
&lt;p&gt;The above statement is the tag line for my new software, Simidude. The name means something like &quot;similar dude&quot; which reflects the nature of the thing. The application synchronizes the clipboard of your computer over its border with other computers that also run Simidude. It also allows you to drag a file, folder or text unto one Simidude window and, after wandering over to your other machine, drag it from there to its destination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;why?&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Why?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I often work with different computers. I have one development machine. On this computer I have several virtual machines for testing purposes. Then I work on a client's machine which he gave me specifically for the work in his projects. Now it happened often enough that I was searching the web for some information. When I found a URL I needed to transfer it to one of the other machines. To do this I would either send the URL via mail and grab the mail from the other machine or put the URL in a text file which I would then copy to a network drive or usb stick. Well, most often I would just rewrite the URL on the target machine. I now from people I work with at my client's offices that suffer from the same problem. Multiple machines but no easy way to quickly transfer this kind of data between them. That was when the idea for Simidude was born. &amp;#91;caption id=&quot;attachment&amp;#95;64&quot; align=&quot;alignright&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; caption=&quot;Simidude beta&quot;&amp;#93;&lt;a href='/img/uploads/2008/11/screenshot003.jpg'&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/uploads/screenshot003-300x199.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Simidude beta&quot; title= &quot;screenshot003&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#91;/caption&amp;#93; Develop an application that would run on different platforms. It sits quietly in the background and monitors your clipboard. Whenever you copy something into it it would send the contents over to the other connected machines. From one of the machines you could then activate the previously copied item and paste it to where you need it. To spice the thing up some bit I thought Drag&amp;Drop might be a great idea, too. So now you can take a file, url, text or even a folder and drag it unto one Simidude instance. From one of the other connected Simidude instances you drag the item and drop it to its destination- drop a url into your browser, text into a word processor or files into the file system. It's actually pretty simple. So this blog will hold information about the development status of Simidude as well as other stuff I run across while developing it. If you have questions please don't hesitate to contact me, please see &lt;a href='http://www.simidude.com/support/'&gt;Simidude's support page&lt;/a&gt; for contact options. I always welcome your feedback! Enjoy the ride, Torsten.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hi all, I have just released version 1.1.1 of DobuDish. Changes to the prior version include bug fixes with the new global hooks as well an improved documentation to include all available hooks with a tiny description. Please get DobuDish at &lt;a href=&quot;http://cms.agynamix.de/downloads/cat&lt;i&gt;view-2.html&quot;&gt;http://cms.agynamix.de/downloads/cat&lt;/i&gt;view-2.html&lt;/a&gt; Enjoy, Torsten.&lt;/p&gt;

Announce: Version 1.1.0 of DobuDish released
</title>
<description>
&lt;p&gt;Hi all, today I released version 1.1.0 of DobuDish. The change: I have added new global-&amp;#91;pre/post&amp;#93; targets to DobuDish as well as an initially empty file &quot;system/etc/build-user-augments.xml&quot; which is supposed to hold user defined actions for the global targets. The logic is as follow:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;first try to execute a local target&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;if that does not exist, try to execute the corresponding global target. That way you can overwrite global actions with local ones. Please note if a local action is found, the corresponding global action is not executed- unless you explicitely call it inside the local action.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can download DobuDish at the &lt;a href='http://cms.agynamix.de/downloads/cat_view-2.html'&gt;usual place&lt;/a&gt;. Enjoy, Torsten.&lt;/p&gt;

Announce: Dopus renamed to DobuDish
</title>
<description>
&lt;p&gt;Dear Dopus user, yesterday I have uploaded a new version of Dopus under its new name, DobuDish. I have renamed the Docbook Framework to resolve a naming conflict with the &lt;a href='http://www.gpsoft.com.au/Intro.html'&gt;original Dopus software&lt;/a&gt;. This release features new Ant hooks called during the creation of a new document. Now that these things are in order I have decided to release this new version as 1.0.0. As always you can getDobuDish at our &lt;a href='http://cms.agynamix.de/downloads/cat_view-2.html'&gt;download side&lt;/a&gt;. Enjoy, Torsten.&lt;/p&gt;

Keep Wordpress up to date with Subversion
</title>
<description>
&lt;p&gt;I use Wordpress as my blogging system. I'm very satisfied. I need to keep it up to date. Now it's daunting to do the whole update ceremony by hand. Wouldn't it be nice if there where an automated mechanism? There is. ![101-0133&amp;#95;IMG](/img/uploads/2008/05/101-0133-img.jpg)The german [CT](http://www.heise.de/ct/) magazine published an article about using Subversion for automated updates. The idea is so simple I'm embarrassed I didn't think of it before! Wordpress uses Subversion as it's source control system. In Subversion you usually create a directory &quot;branches&quot; where a directory is created for each release branch. And then there's a directory &quot;tags&quot; which contains a tag name (like &quot;2.5.1&quot; which is the latest release as of this post) for every release. Now what you can do is check out (svn co) the Wordpress code from the Subversion repository telling it you want to the, say, release tagged with &quot;2.5.1&quot;. Subversion will copy the code into a specified directory and will also keep the Subversion metadata (&quot;.svn&quot; directories) in place. Now whenever the fine folks at Wordpress release their version &quot;2.5.2&quot; you &quot;switch&quot; the code over to that tag, Subversion automatically updates your local sources with the latest changes from the repository and you are done. For all this stuff to work you need the Subversion client installed on your Wordpress host as well as ssh access to your account. To install Subversion on a Debian based system like Ubuntu you just say &quot;apt-get install subversion&quot; and it will be installed if not already present. The Wordpress repository is located at &lt;a href=&quot;http://svn.automattic.com/wordpress&quot;&gt;http://svn.automattic.com/wordpress&lt;/a&gt;. If you want to checkout the &quot;2.5.1&quot; release tag you would issues the following command:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt; svn co http://svn.automattic.com/wordpress/tags/2.5.1 blog &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This would check out the release version &quot;2.5.1&quot; into a directory &quot;blog&quot; which will be created by Subversion in the current directory. After that you need to adjust the file permissions so that your web server can access the files and directories. The following command is valid for Ubuntu (and probably other Debian-based systems as well):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt; chown -R www-data.www-data blog &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, suppose Wordpress releases version &quot;2.5.2&quot; you would issues the following commands from within your &quot;blog&quot; directory to update your local copy:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt; svn switch http://svn.automattic.com/wordpress/tags/2.5.2 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's it. The folks at &lt;a href='http://www.heise.de'&gt;Heise&lt;/a&gt; even released a GPL'ed script which encapsulates the Subversion commands. It even let's you add specific language files to your Wordpress installation. I have attached the wptool to this post.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href='http://blog.agynamix.de/wp-content/uploads/2008/05/wptool-10.tgz'&gt;wptool-10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;As always I hope I could solve a few pain points in your life as a blogger...&lt;/p&gt;

How to differentiate in a crowded market
</title>
<description>
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href='/img/uploads/2008/05/img-2444.jpg'&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/uploads/2008/05/img-2444-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;IMG&amp;#95;2444&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Last year in October we went shopping for a construction company for our new home. Currently I have rented office space and I'd rather have living and working space together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since we life in a &lt;a href='http://maps.google.de/maps?f=q&amp;hl=de&amp;geocode=&amp;q=tannenstr,+09380+thalheim&amp;sll=51.623025,12.27574&amp;sspn=0.010577,0.015621&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;t=h&amp;z=16'&gt;mountainous area&lt;/a&gt; houses are usually build here with brick and mortar. Now I don't know how it is in your area but here there are probably more construction companies per village than... than... well, actually I don't know. But there are many. You can choose your flavor from a vast variety. Do you want to build with sand stone, bricks, gas concrete- whatever you like there's always a dozen companies that tell you that there solution is best.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sounds familiar? The situation reminded me of the IT landscape. There are so many software shops and experts that try to sell you at their golden hammer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The thing is it probably doesn't matter if you use Java to build a system or Ruby or Python or PHP. Or you use Perl, that way you won't need an obfuscator...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What is most important though is that the people who build your system or house know what they're doing. It saves you a lot of trouble if you hire real experts. Not just marketing guys that know how to draw bubbles and present them to you as your nearly finished system (&quot;We just need to generate the code...&quot;) but people who know of the technical details, who know how to communicate between teams so that the work flow does not get interrupted and, most of all, who you can trust.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href='/img/uploads/2008/05/img-2455.jpg'&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/uploads/2008/05/img-2455-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;IMG&amp;#95;2455&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Trust goes a long way. Now how did we come to choose the architect and construction company for our house? And they haven't been the cheapest of all the options we had!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several reasons: First and probably most important they have an excellent reputation in our area. I spoke to a dozen of home owners and they all recommended &lt;a href='http://www.gerlachbau.de/'&gt;that company&lt;/a&gt;. That started to build my trust and in the end I believe it was a big weight in their favor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second they where (and still are) very friendly and honest about the things they would or would not do. For instance they did not try to sell me every possible energy saving option you can possibly stuff into your house but only what they believed is the best mixture of options. I never had the feeling that they tried to sell me as much as possible but rather they tried to cater my needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Third they brought in their own ideas. I had a basic type of building in mind when I started to contact the companies. Some tried to sell me as much as they could, some just took the plans and calculated a price. What &lt;a href='http://www.gerlachbau.de/'&gt;Gerlach Bau&lt;/a&gt; did was to bring in their own experience and creativity. They really helped us develop a house that would fit better than our initial plans. They told us the things they would do different and really made us consider options we didn't know existed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another very important thing is the proximity to us. The short distance makes it pretty easy for us to just drop by at their office and talk about things that are not yet clear. Or for them to meet with us at the site. As &lt;a href='http://www.userscape.com/products/helpspot/'&gt;Ian&lt;/a&gt; has &lt;a href='http://www.userscape.com/blog/index.php/site/comments/talking_to_the_owner/'&gt;written in his blog&lt;/a&gt; it is so important to have a fast and easy way to talk to the one in charge (the one who really can make decisions).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href='/img/uploads/2008/05/img-1860-2.jpg'&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/uploads/2008/05/img-1860-2-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;IMG&amp;#95;1860-2&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Now that the construction is going along I can say I'm very pleased. They started in mid March (There is a lot of daunting paperwork involved before you are allowed to build a house on your own ground.). Next week we'll have the topping out ceremony (that's basically when the beams of the roof are in place).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a fantastic coordination between the different teams at the construction site. All the material they needed was delivered right on time- nobody had to wait. They call in right on time when things need to be discussed in order to maintain a smooth work flow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now what can we learn from that?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First they life and thrive in a very crowded market. They are located in an area where many companies try to compete by price (of course if you choose a company that does this you have to life with the result.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their greatest bonus is their reputation. of course they need to maintain it with each new customer which in turn builds a better reputation. They respond to our needs and wishes which gives them a great customer service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href='/img/uploads/2008/05/img-2447.jpg'&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/uploads/2008/05/img-2447-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;IMG&amp;#95;2447&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; All in all a lot of attitudes that you as a successful software company would want to copy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stick to the things you know and build your expertise in your area of interest. Then when customers approach you you have the chance to exceed their expectations by using your honesty and knowledge. Compared with a great customer service you will build a reputation for you and your company that soon will attract new customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is my observation with the recent events that are going on here. What do you think?&lt;/p&gt;

Announce: Dopus 0.9.16 released
</title>
<description>
&lt;p&gt;Dear Dopus users, I just release version 0.9.16 of Dopus. This is a bugfix release, with the following enhancements:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fixed bug with the new document.type mechanism. There was an oversight for documents that contain sub documents of a different document type than the main document. In localbuild.properties you can now add additional entries of the for document.&amp;lt;file name&amp;gt;.type=article|book|... Now when you process your sub document and an entry for this document is found it overwrites the document.type setting. This also is possible for the master document. So you might set document.type to the default document type and overwrite only those that differ from that one.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dopus can be downloaded from the &lt;a href='http://cms.agynamix.de/downloads/cat_view-2.html'&gt;usual place&lt;/a&gt;. Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;

Nested properties in Ant
</title>
<description>
&lt;p&gt;Today while scripting my &lt;a href='http://cms.agynamix.de/downloads/cat_view-2.html'&gt;Dopus&lt;/a&gt; Ant files I came across a problem with nested properties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Something of the sort &lt;code&gt;${document.${input.file}.type}&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Turns out that Ant cannot do this by default. Yet I found a &lt;a href='http://blog.joerghoh.de/index.php?/archives/93-Ant-Properties-indirekt-aufloesen.html'&gt;blog entry&lt;/a&gt; that explains how it can be done with newer versions of Ant (those that support macros). I adapted the solution a little bit with the following result:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt; &amp;lt;!-- Needed to resolve a nested property like ${document.${input.file}.type} --&amp;gt;
 &amp;lt;macrodef name=&amp;quot;resolveProperty&amp;quot;&amp;gt;
     &amp;lt;attribute name=&amp;quot;property&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;
     &amp;lt;attribute name=&amp;quot;value&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;
     &amp;lt;sequential&amp;gt;
       &amp;lt;property name=&amp;quot;tmp1.@{property}&amp;quot; value=&amp;quot;document.@{value}.type&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;
       &amp;lt;resolveProperty2 property=&amp;quot;@{property}&amp;quot; value=&amp;quot;${tmp1.@{property}}&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;
     &amp;lt;/sequential&amp;gt;
 &amp;lt;/macrodef&amp;gt;

 &amp;lt;macrodef name=&amp;quot;resolveProperty2&amp;quot;&amp;gt;
   &amp;lt;attribute name=&amp;quot;property&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;
   &amp;lt;attribute name=&amp;quot;value&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;
   &amp;lt;sequential&amp;gt;
     &amp;lt;property name=&amp;quot;@{property}&amp;quot; value=&amp;quot;${@{value}}&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;
   &amp;lt;/sequential&amp;gt;
 &amp;lt;/macrodef&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now I can set my property like so:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt; &amp;lt;resolveProperty property=&amp;quot;document.calculated.type&amp;quot; value=&amp;quot;${project.input.file}&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;which effectively sets &lt;code&gt;document.calculated.type=${document.${project.input.file}.type}&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nice.&lt;/p&gt;

Announce: Dopus 0.9.15 released
</title>
<description>
&lt;p&gt;Dear Dopus user and all those who wish to become one, I just release version 0.9.15 of Dopus. This is a bugfix release, with the following enhancements:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;There is a new property in localbuild.properties which determines the type of the document. The templates have been adapted but you have to adapt your existing documents yourself. To do that please insert into localbuild.properties: document.type = &amp;lt;doctype&amp;gt; where &amp;lt;doctype&amp;gt; is one of &lt;span class=&quot;emphasis&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;book, article, set, slides, webpage&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. The old way is still supported but deprecated.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cleaned up some glitches with the website document type.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dopus can be downloaded from the &lt;a href='http://cms.agynamix.de/downloads/cat_view-2.html'&gt;usual place&lt;/a&gt;. Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;

Cut out dead wood
</title>
<description>
&lt;p&gt;I realize I haven't written anything about myself for a while. I apologize. Times where (and still are) very turbulent for me during those days. By the end of December I laid off my last employee which basically means I'm working alone now. I finally realized that I was trying to keep something alive that wouldn't survive naturally. The problem was that I was trying to establish a market for us in more than one different domains of expertise at the same time. See, I am a software developer. That's what I do and what I love. I do this for over a decade now. I'm inclined to say that I know a fair amount about this software segment (java in particular) I'm working in. On the other hand my employee was hired to develop our website which he did well. He is also quiet good with computer hardware and graphics design. So I was hoping to enter into these markets (web design and hardware) as well. Hmm. Now, it's not only hard to play in a market you know nothing about, it's actually quiet impossible. There are different rules in web design, different customer types, different approaches to customers. I knew nothing about. But anyway I was trying hard to preserve that place of work for him- until I finally realized that it's draining all my energy! My plan was to safe money from my consulting work with customers so that I could later spent time developing my own products. But instead I spent money and- much worse- a lot of time trying to establish a market where I don't belong to. I would like to give you dear reader, this advice: don't employ someone just because it's a friend and you want to help! If that person would detour you from your business vision don't go that way! It won't help him much and it will burden your relationship. It's hard to believe how many mistakes one can make :) But I'm very thankful that they just cost time and money and not the future. We (my family and I) are now recovering from the spent energy and experienced frustration and will focus AGYNAMIX into a proper direction. That means, we won't go after more than one vision and thus tearing the company apart. I already have some ideas of software products that would prove useful in my day to day work. I just have to decide which idea to pursue :) And that's actually another advice I'd like to offer: develop a product for a domain where you have a deep knowledge about! My first product was a monitoring software for water supply companies. I went into this because a befriended electronics company needed a software to complete their portfolio. I didn't know anything about this domain and made a lot of false assumptions during the course of development. It's best you can develop a software that you need to work with on a daily basis. This actually means you will discover their bugs and quirks. You will end up with a very polished product because, as a proud software developer you hate to work with crappy software :) I sincerely hope that writing down those things will prevent others from some of their mistakes. Although I realize that some mistakes just have to be made in order to realize it really is wrong :) See you!&lt;/p&gt;

Google Collections API
</title>
<description>
&lt;p&gt;Recently, while listening to the &lt;a href='http://www.javaposse.com/'&gt;JavaPosse podcast&lt;/a&gt; I learned about the &lt;a href='http://code.google.com/p/google-collections/'&gt;Google Collections API&lt;/a&gt;, a collections of enhancements to the original Java codebase. Not unlike &lt;a href='http://commons.apache.org/collections/'&gt;Apache commons collections&lt;/a&gt; it enhances the Java programming experience in several ways. It's definetly worth checking out. There is a &lt;a href='http://publicobject.com/2007/09/series-recap-coding-in-small-with.html'&gt;fine tutorial&lt;/a&gt; which explains parts of the API with code sample and explanations. Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;

Announce: Dopus 0.9.14 released
</title>
<description>
&lt;p&gt;I wrapped up a new release of Dopus. This release includes a few bugfixes as well as new support for Docbook Website creation. From the release notes:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Version 0.9.14&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Support for Website creation. The new targets &quot;ws-tab&quot; for the creation of tabular website and &quot;website&quot; for non tabular websites.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you now create a directory &quot;copy&amp;#95;to&amp;#95;output&quot; it's content will entirely and recursively be copied to the output directory.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You can now have a folder &quot;common-files&quot; in the &quot;custom-cfg&quot; folder of your document. If that one exists, common files will be taken from there instead from the global &quot;custom-xsl&quot; directory.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cleaned up a bug in the generator script that appeared on Linux.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;No more warnings when a specific style.css is not available&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dopus is available for download at the &lt;a href='http://cms.agynamix.de/downloads/cat_view-2.html'&gt;usual place&lt;/a&gt;. Please test the new website feature and report any bugs via the &lt;a href='http://helpdesk.agynamix.de/'&gt;helpdesk&lt;/a&gt;. Tell me what you think! Thanks for using Dopus, and enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just read an interesting article about software scheduling strategies over at &quot;&lt;a href='http://www.joelonsoftware.com'&gt;Joel on Software&lt;/a&gt;&quot;. I found it rather interesting- so without further ado, here's the link: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2007/10/26.html&quot;&gt;http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2007/10/26.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Nice words for Dopus
</title>
<description>
&lt;p&gt;I got some trackbacks on Dopus recently which I really do like. I'd like to thank you guys for your nice encouraging words (&lt;a href='http://www.simplifiedcomplexity.com/blog/mgalvin/a-complete-self-contained-cross-platform-docbook-toolchain'&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and I'm sure there are more). I'm curious how many people actively use Dopus?&lt;/p&gt;

Announce: Dopus 0.9.13 released
</title>
<description>
&lt;p&gt;I wrapped up a new release of Dopus. This is a bug fix release. There was a problem with the included fonts (there XML description files) that made them unsearchable in applications like Acrobat Reader. While I was at it I clean up some other minor glitches. Dopus is available for download at the &lt;a href='http://cms.agynamix.de/downloads/cat_view-2.html'&gt;usual place&lt;/a&gt;. I'm planning to wrap together a new version of Dopus (possibly under a new name- or just Dopus2) that would sport Docbook 5 and FOP 0.93 (the latest version) support. I find it rather hard to support a package that holds two so different Docbook versions and therefore would rather go the route to release a new bundle. I'd like to hear from you about this. Tell me what you think! Thanks for using Dopus, and enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;

reCaptcha to the rescue
</title>
<description>
&lt;p&gt;Spam is a bad thing. Spam is ugly, dumb- I don't want it. Probably as much as you do. A while ago I listened to one of the [TWIT](http://www.twit.tv/) networks &quot;[Security Now](http://www.twit.tv/SN)&quot; podcasts entitled &quot;[Are you human?](http://www.twit.tv/sn101)&quot;. In this episode Steve Gibson explains the Captcha mechanism (which stands for &quot;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&quot;&amp;#91;Wikipedia&amp;#93;) and the newly created (at Carnedie Mellon University) reCaptcha mechanism. Both are ways to solve the (actually pretty hard) problem to tell humans and machines apart (Are you a Who?) which is also known as the &quot;Turing Test&quot;. Now pattern recognition is getting better and better and computers are gaining rapidly in speed which makes this a harder problem with each passing year. There are now enough algorithms to fool the Captcha mechanisms used at big sites. [reCaptcha](http://recaptcha.net/) to the rescue. ![recaptcha.JPG](/img/uploads/2007/08/recaptcha.JPG) There are several projects going on currently that try to digitize paper books so that they can be archived in digital form, read online, etc. It's so much nicer to have a digital text- you can search it, reformat it. Well, you can't decorate your house- maybe you can use the digital book pages to decorate your ranch in &quot;Second Life™&quot;? Anyway, they use the best OCR (Optical Character Recognition) software available and are still not able to scan all texts for whatever reason. Now that means that those OCR algorithms out there are not able to digitize parts of those books correctly. reCaptcha then takes those words, obfuscates them even more and presents them to the user. Humans, of course, usually recognize the words and can tell the computer the meaning. reCaptcha always presents you two words: one which is known to the system and one that isn't. The unknown word is presented in multiple combinations with different known words to different users. When a certain amount of users have read the word the same way the words is declared to be known. It is then added to the dictionary of known words. Using this algorithm you actually help digitizing those huge amounts of paper books! So the moral? LEAVE MORE COMMENTS! :) I'd be interested in your opinion upon this thing. Especially, would this mechanism discourage you to leave a comment?&lt;/p&gt;

My world broke into pieces
</title>
<description>
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yesterday, the incredible happened.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/uploads/2007/08/100-0014_img.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;100-0014&amp;#95;img.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In just a moment, with the blinking of an eye, the world I had know was destroyed. Scattered. What happened, you may ask (and even if you don't because you don't bother a slightest bit I'm gonna tell you)?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our TV broke.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's gone. It won't come back. The world is changing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Friday morning our son was home alone (no, his name is not Kevin). In an attempt to do something good he wanted to pull something up from behind our living room shelf. To do so he had to pull the TV slightly forward, just slightly, just a little bit, uh, too late. The whole thing crashed out of the shelf onto the floor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now there is a gaping whole where there once was that thing that brought entertainment into relaxing evenings. And now? Do I have to start thinking again? Do I now have to do something useful instead of just consuming &quot;NaviCIS&quot;, &quot;Monk&quot; or &quot;The Unit&quot;?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While I hate that thought I actually think Daniel (that son) did something great. He just took that darn thing out that consumed so much time. Of course it's a pain to adjust to the new requirements, but I honestly think (while I'm by far not sure if Idon't just hush out and buy a new one- shiny, full HD, Media Center ready piece of time consuming plastic) we're into something good. And it's also interesting to watch the own soul. How much did I get accustomed to the thing? Puh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And you know, my wife just insists in not buying a new one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href='http://blog.agynamix.de/?attachment_id=108 &quot;img_0110.jpg&quot;'&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/uploads/2007/08/img_0110.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;img&amp;#95;0110.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I still love her.&lt;/p&gt;

Announce: Dopus 0.9.12 released
</title>
<description>
&lt;p&gt;I just released Dopus 0.9.12. Here is a not so precise list of some of the changes:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;fixed some bugs with the SET docbook type&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;added more target hooks to the build process so you can customize more flexible&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;added a description (although very shallow I admit) of all available target hooks to the manual&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Go &lt;a href='http://cms.agynamix.de/downloads/cat_view-2.html'&gt;grab it&lt;/a&gt; while it's hot :) Here's a short description of Dopus: &quot;Dopus is a Docbook publishing framework. It was designed with portability and extensibility in mind. Dopus can run on any Windows or Unix platform that supports Java. We host Dopus here on our website as a free product that we want to give back to the Docbook community. The Dopus framework is distributed under the GNU General Public License. The various parts of the Dopus framework are distributed under their respective (free) licenses.&quot;Torsten.&lt;/p&gt;

FogBugz 6 Beta
</title>
<description>
&lt;p&gt;Today I got a mail from Fogcreek with a download think to their latest beta of FogBugz. We have it running on a Windows 2003 server with a mysql 5 database. The upgrade from a recent version 5 was super easy I have to say. Just clicked through the installer and upgraded the database through the website. Everything ran smooth and without trouble. The biggest most impressive change that has just leaped out of the browser and banged at my head was the wiki integration. With a WYSIWYG editor that actually works! It was very easy to create tables and edit them or create links to other content. Speaking of links, one can of course link to a FogBugz case from a wiki page. When done the linked to case will reflect the wiki pages that contain links to this case. Way cool! I love it so far.&lt;/p&gt;

Grails and Maven rants
</title>
<description>
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grails:&lt;/strong&gt; Lately I've been delving into the &lt;a href='http://grails.codehaus.org/'&gt;Grails&lt;/a&gt; project. Grails is something like &lt;a href='http://www.rubyonrails.org/'&gt;Ruby on Rails&lt;/a&gt; but for the Java world. It uses the &lt;a href='http://groovy.codehaus.org/'&gt;Groovy&lt;/a&gt; language, a dynamic language similar to Ruby but with Java syntax and a tight integration into the Java VM. Groovy brings those great features like Closures to Java developers. Since I can't deny 10 years of Java experience I'm somewhat dran to this solution, rather than to Rails. Now for those you would like to delve into Grails, there is a free book available at &lt;a href='http://www.infoq.com/minibooks/grails'&gt;InfoQ&lt;/a&gt;. It might help you understand it's potential which to a great degree comes from the underlying Groovy. &lt;strong&gt;Maven:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href='http://maven.apache.org/'&gt;Maven&lt;/a&gt; is a project management tool for Java projects. It supports building projects just like &lt;a href='http://ant.apache.org/'&gt;Ant&lt;/a&gt; but is supposed to go much further. It allows you to specify dependencies to other projects or 3rd party libraries. It also build a nice web site for you containing build stats, Javadoc and Documentation. Until now I'm using Ant for building my projects. I have used Maven 1.0 for the server part of our Net-Herald application. What I do not like in the Maven approach is that all artefacts (3rd party libs, generated libs from own projects) live in a repository. If a dependency is not met, Maven tries to fetch it from a mirror. This works most of the time for open source libs, but of course must fail if you depend on commercial or your own libs. Anyway I like my dependencies to be in Subversion along with the source. Some people say this is wrong. But for me I just know where all the stuff is... But still I wanna give a new try to Maven. And today I found this &lt;a href='http://www.devzuz.com/web/guest/products/resources?gclid=CID3rsXTyYwCFQlrXgodoU6JQg#BBWM'&gt;free Maven book online at DevZuz&lt;/a&gt;. So mayve you find those books helpful. Tell me what you think regarding Build management. This is an area where I think a lot can be improved- especially in my case :)&lt;/p&gt;

Some of my mistakes
</title>
<description>
&lt;p&gt;Now, people love to write about success. Me too. But I guess it is more valuable to write about failure. Or mistakes one makes. The process of making mistakes, recognizing them and learning not to repeat them is probably one of the most important in a person's life. And so it is for a company. A while ago I enjoyed reading Eric Sink's article &quot;&lt;a href='http://www.ericsink.com/bos/Make_More_Mistakes.html'&gt;Make more mistakes&lt;/a&gt;&quot;. It speaks about the importance of making mistakes and learning from them. Now while I think everyone makes them, only few people decide to write about their failures. It just doesn't feel as good as telling the world about your million dollar success... Since I have no million dollar success to report about I decided to share some of the mistakes I made. In the hope to help you avoid the same traps.&lt;a href='/img/uploads/2007/05/img_0193.jpg &quot;img_0193.jpg&quot;'&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/uploads/2007/05/img_0193.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;img&amp;#95;0193.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; It all began when I started my company back in 2005. I started solo in April and relatively quickly decided to employ people. It's surely not wrong to employ someone- if there is a reason for. It all has to do with insecurity and lack of entrepreneural knowledge. And because I think I'm not too special in that aspect I suspect that there are others out there with the same problems which I faced. First, there is vision. If you start a company, may it be solo or with people, you need to have a vision. You need to know where you wanna go to, what your goals are, your ethics, your philosophy. Of course that vision will change and adapt over time. But if you start without you'll end up running circles and getting nowhere. It is very important that you as the leader of the company carry that vision in your heart. My vision was to have a company. I'm a software professional, a geek. I want to write great software. I want to do it the way I see fit. But my vision was not very deep rooted. I kind of took a short cut. I thought &quot;Well, I'll employ great people and provide a place for them to be creative. I just add their abilities and their visions to mine. So we end up with a great, unique powerful vision.&quot; It won't work! If you as the leader can not provide the guidlines of your company you'll end up having a bunch of talented people that still don't fit in. Because you have not defined where you want them to fit in. If you as the leader do not have the vision how do you know who's good for your job and who's not. So after I started solo someone wanted me to create a website for them. I was pretty busy developing Net-Herald, our monitoring application. But I knew some friend of mine who is very creative and has done websites before. Since he was looking for a job at that time I offered him a place in my company and thought &quot;Well, maybe we can position ourself within this market. He is also a PC hardware expert, so maybe we can sell hardware to our clients, too.&quot; So I employed him in August 2005. In November 2005 we needed to develop a brochure for Net-Herald (did I say it, that's our monitoring application). There was another friend moving up to our area who studied media design. So I thought &quot;Maybe we can position ourself in that market, too. He is very creative. There surely are many great synergy effects. He can write the documentation for Net-Herald (our ...), he can concept the texts on our website, etc.&quot; Now we created a few websites since then. And he did a great job designing that brochure. And we had some synergy effects. But (that's a huge, underlined, blinking red BUT)- these are no reasons for employing people! What were the reasons I did it in the first place:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;They where friends and I wanted to have them a job. And I thought it might be great to have friends around.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I didn't have a vision my own! I was just looking for opportunities. We thought: We are very good at our job. We can do a lot of things.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, it's a special thing to have friends work for you. Beware! If the friendship came before the employment relationship then it can simply be that your friends expect you to handle them nicely. Never work late. Never work on Saturday's. And you- you don't want to kill the friendship. So you end up taking part of there work on your shoulder. Concerning the second point: Of course, you can do a lot of things. But a lot of them are not in the center of your heart and they will be done mediocre. There is only a small subset of things that I can do really good. For instance we tried to sell Linux small business servers- with Open Exchange, Hylafax and all that kind of stuff. Why? because I had someone who can assemble the hardware and I needed work for him. Or we tried to sell VoIP contracts for the same reason. Here is a big thing I learned: Do not employ someone and then seek work for him. Rather employ someone for the work you have that you can't get done on your own. If you are not an expert in a field than it's no fun to go in there because there are a lot of people who are better. Stay in your field of expertise, grow there, learn more. Find people who will work for you in your field of expertise! Again, I made those mistakes because I had no clear vision! And actually, we are still about to define it! It is a process to find your identity. It takes time to grow into being a business. But if I had stayed on my own I would have been faster in finding the center of my venture. I want o develop software. I don't mind changing the language or the domain I develop software for. But it's about software. I've done a lot of database backed applications in Java- so that defines my current field of expertise. I'm willing to learn more and to move to different fields- but it will always be about software. And that's large enough :) I'm looking for product opportunities within this field. Because this is what I know best and where I have the most expertise. I won't try and do something alien to me. It's not fun and the result won't be great. Another thing that kept me alive over the years was that I didn't threw away that contacts I had with my former employer. So after a while I got a contract from him as a freelancer. That consulting business brought the money to feed me and my 2 employees. But that's not the purpose of having employees. They are supposed to make mony for you, aren't they? They are supposed to work on your field of expertise and help you grow a company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So after more then a year I laid off one of my employees which relieved me a great deal from having to care for three. The other one is doing a great job in supporting our Net-Herald and other customers and maintaining our and our client's websites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href='/img/uploads/2007/05/img_0111.jpg &quot;img_0111.jpg&quot;'&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/uploads/2007/05/img_0111.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;img&amp;#95;0111.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moral: I find the most important lesson here is the importance of a vision. A vision that is unique to you, not just borrowed from someone else. A vision that will sustain you in rough times. I vision that actually defines your identity and the work you want to do. There is no short cut in finding a vision. It takes time. But it's worth it. Dear reader, I'd love to receive feedback from you. Write about your experiences... In the hope of being of value to those brave entrepreneurs out there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I made some painful observations in friends companies that I don't want to keep from you. When I started AGYNAMIX in spring 2005 I was thinking to start the (ad)venture together with a friend. We had talked about the idea of founding a company and developing our own software the way we think is best. When I talked about this to a close friend of mine he stressed the point that it is so important to know who is leading the company. Over the course of time you will have an argument about what is the right way and what is not- now, who decides in the end? If no one can make a decision because both own the company with an equal share you are stuck- you cannot make a move. Or you will try to find a foul compromise that will eventually ruin the company and your friendship. Since I was the one who was having the vision and I was the one who quit his job I also wanted the right to make the final decision- which my friend (who stayed in his job) could'n agree with. So we agreed to disagree and I founded the company myself. Back then I didn't see the impoartance of this so much but the more time passes the more I see companies struggling because they don't have a lined up leadership. I see companies where both partners have an equal share and they just cannot agree about the strategy of their firm. Maybe their both views are valid, but because they cannot agree they move very slowly- and that's the worst thing of all. You spend so much time and energy arguing about what to do and how and when that you have no strength left for your customers! So as an advice to fellows thinking about starting up- Decide who will make the final decision. Now I think it is good not to start alone. If you have someone who will encourage you when time get rough and they will), but then there will also be times when you argue about the company's future. Then you need to be able to move forward even if you do not agree. Now go back to work :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had some intern work done lately. Two of the results are a simple Tax Calculator and a port of TiddlyWiki to the Windows Vista™ Sidebar. The Tax Calculator is useful if you have to recalculate between a gross and a net value of some amount of money. In the Calculator you just enter the amount and then push one of two buttons depending if you want to convert from gross to net or the other way round. You can grab a copy &lt;a href='http://cms.agynamix.de/downloads/cat_view-2.html'&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. The SideWiki is a port of the popular &lt;a href='http://www.tiddlywiki.com/'&gt;TiddlyWiki&lt;/a&gt;. As TiddlyWiki SideWiki runs within the IE engine that drives the Vista Sidebar. It does not need any server. You can use it to store your personal information in a wiki styled tool. Also, if you follow the &lt;a href='http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done'&gt;Getting Thing Done (GTD)&lt;/a&gt; (developed by &lt;a href='http://www.davidco.com/'&gt;David Allen&lt;/a&gt;) methodology, this tool is for you! SideWiki is still kind of a beta since it lacks documentation and might still have a few rough edges. But give it a try and us the feedback. Enjoy, Torsten.&lt;/p&gt;

Dopus 0.9.9 released
</title>
<description>
&lt;p&gt;Hi everybody, right now (well actually, a few minutes ago) I released a new version of the Docbook Publishing Tool &lt;a href='http://cms.agynamix.de/downloads/cat_view-2.html'&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dopus&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. I'm sorry for the quietness around but I was very busy with projects at my customers places, own projects and, of course, the very cool EclipseCon. Anyway, without boring you to dust, here are the new features of this release:&lt;a href='/img/uploads/2007/03/img_1673.jpg &quot;img_1673.jpg&quot;'&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/uploads/2007/03/img_1673.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;img&amp;#95;1673.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Some people reguested Docbook Slides support. Well, here it is. Dopus does not yet support SVG or htmlhelp for Docbook Slides (you are welcome to help me figure out why). But it does support: PDF, HTML, XHTML and the table and frame versions of HTML and XHTML. To create a Slides document, just type:&lt;a href='/img/uploads/2007/03/img_1673.jpg &quot;img_1673.jpg&quot;'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;generator.bat fluffyslides create slides&lt;/em&gt; After that, you can use these targets to generate output:&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;pdf&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;html&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;tablehtml&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;framehtml&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;xhtml&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;tablexhtml&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;framexhtml&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dopus is now packaged on a Mac. Ant on Unix systems supports the setting of the executable flag for files. So now when you unpack the Dopus archive you don't have to change the file mode of generator.sh anymore- it works out of the box.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can download Dopus as usual in our&lt;a href='http://cms.agynamix.de/downloads/cat_view-2.html'&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href='http://cms.agynamix.de/downloads/cat_view-2.html'&gt;download area&lt;/a&gt;. Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;

EclipseCon 2007: Day 4
</title>
<description>
&lt;p&gt;Well, today was the last day of this conference. It was a very exciting event. Since it was my first EclipseCon I can't compare it to the previous ones. But there was some kind of special spirit there- people, yet from different backgrounds and following different goals still had some common ground- Eclipse. The day started with a gorgeous keynote by Dr. Herbert Thomson. He talked about software security. Well actually, he didn't just talk, rather passionately convincing the audience about the matter. He was speaking about fuzzy testing- injecting random bytes of characters into an application. And within a few minutes he showed (live) how the Macromedia FlashPlayer 6 could be compromised by finding possible stack overflows through fuzzy testing. Pretty amazing... There was another talk about security in &lt;a href='http://www.eclipsecon.org/2007/index.php?page=sub/&amp;id=3889'&gt;Eclipse applications&lt;/a&gt; . Neil Bartlett pointed to a project called &lt;a href='http://sourceforge.net/projects/eclipse-jaas'&gt;Eclipse-JAAS&lt;/a&gt; which he started to address security in RCP client server applications. After lunch two ladies from the Eclipse team &lt;a href='http://www.eclipsecon.org/2007/index.php?page=sub/&amp;id=3726'&gt;intruduced the Eclipse test framework&lt;/a&gt; (org.eclipse.test) which they use to automatically unit test and performance test the Eclipse SDK. Finally, Mike Milinkovich and a row of project leads held a panel at the theater to talk about the future of Eclipse and answer questions. According to the board there where 1353 attendees which drank 665 gallons of coffee. &lt;a href='/img/uploads/2007/03/img_1667.jpg &quot;img_1667.jpg&quot;'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/uploads/2007/03/img_1667.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;img&amp;#95;1667.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What I especially liked, apart from the talks, is the idea of table topics. Every lunch table had a sign on declaring the topic of the table. This was something like &quot;BIRT&quot;, &quot;Eclipse on Linux&quot;, &quot;Building a business upon Eclipse&quot;, &quot;SWT&quot;, you name it. This idea basically makes it very easy to come in touch with the people at the table. You already have a topic. So what happened when I sat down at the table was that people asked me (supposed I joined the BIRT club): &quot;Hey, welcome. Are you using BIRT? Tell us about your experience.&quot; Pretty cool. Whenever you need some kind of ice breaker think about it. Now, the idea is pretty simple and straight forward. Yet I cannot remember that I ever came across a place in whatever context who used this idea... Today I sat at the &quot;Eclipse as a business model&quot; table where I met two very friendly japanese guys from NEC® who introduced there open source application &lt;a href='http://jalcedo2.sourceforge.net/xoops/index.php'&gt;JALCEDO&lt;/a&gt; to me. JALCEDO is supposed to make development of client server Eclipse RCP applications easier. According to my table peers one can describe JALCEDO als &quot;Ruby on Rails&quot; for the Eclipse Java world. I'll check it out... The conference was very well organized. There was an army of waiters just serving whatever was needed. The talks where militarily timed and always started on time and ended on time. It was rather amazing to see all the bits flow together like puzzle pieces. It was a pleasure to be there!&lt;/p&gt;

EclipseCon 2007: Day 3
</title>
<description>
&lt;p&gt;Now that the 3rd day at EclipseCon is over, lets reflect a little bit over it. It was the first time I tried the &quot;Continental Breakfast&quot; at the EclipseCon. Well, the sessions and talks where better. Seems this kind of breakfast is not my taste. Never mind. From 9:00 to 10:00 Robert M. Lefkowitz was holding a keynote talk about the anomalies of Open Source software. Very entertaining. After that was my second try to get into an &lt;a href='http://www.eclipsecon.org/2007/index.php?page=sub/&amp;id=4243'&gt;Equinox session&lt;/a&gt;, which failed miserably because either the room was too small or the people where too many. Or both. So since I didn't really get my hand on another talk I found some time to stray around, visit the exhibiters booth and just relax. &lt;a href='/img/uploads/2007/03/img_1730.jpg &quot;img_1730.jpg&quot;'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/uploads/2007/03/img_1730.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;img&amp;#95;1730.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next was &quot;&lt;a href='http://www.eclipsecon.org/2007/index.php?page=sub/&amp;id=3804'&gt;Charting with BIRT&lt;/a&gt;&quot;. After &lt;a href='http://www.eclipsecon.org/2007/index.php?page=sub/&amp;id=3925'&gt;Jason kindled my interest&lt;/a&gt; in the BIRT reporting framework and awakened the hope that I actually can use it and improve my own software with it, I wanted to hear more about it and so, I went there. The session showed the charting capabilities of BIRT. They showed the different types of available charts, which include line, bar, gantt, pie, bubble diagrams in 2d or 3d. Really impressive and with a very flexible Report Editor that actually keeps you from editing source files. It though might be too complex for end users to use it and build their own reports. After lunch I finally cought an &lt;a href='http://www.eclipsecon.org/2007/index.php?page=sub/&amp;id=3849'&gt;Equinox talk&lt;/a&gt; which I actually used to recover from my post lunch coma. It was not the presenters fault, though... Another interesting thing was the &lt;a href='http://www.eclipsecon.org/2007/index.php?page=sub/&amp;id=3752'&gt;RadRails&lt;/a&gt; speech. RadRails is a &lt;a href='http://www.rubyonrails.org/'&gt;Ruby on Rails&lt;/a&gt; IDE. RadRails build upon the Ruby Development Tools (RDT) and Eclipse (either as a bunch of plugins or as an standalone RCP application) to provide Rails developers with an IDE that is supposed to make Rails development even easier. Heck where should this lead to? I mean, writing a Rails application is already sooooo easy and cool :) Kyle Shanks, one of the RadRails developers mentioned, they had 100.000 users by now which seems pretty imressive to me. After that there was a panel on the &lt;a href='http://www.eclipsecon.org/2007/index.php?page=sub/&amp;id=3853'&gt;Data Tools Platform&lt;/a&gt; which I used to freshly install Ruby, Rails and mySQL on my MacBook Pro. RadRails comes next... At the end of the day I had another interesting talk about the &lt;a href='http://www.eclipsecon.org/2007/index.php?page=sub/&amp;id=3884'&gt;dynamics of BIRT&lt;/a&gt;. The presenterscame up with a lot of examples to show how easy it is to script your report or to even script the parameter dialog that is presented to the user. In the end they showed a dynamic report which held a table of addresses. When clicking on of the addresses that position was loaded into Google Maps and presented on top of the table within the dialog. Bad thing is you can only do this as long as you did not print the dialog... All in all it was again a very exciting day. Tomorrow will be the last day (of EclipseCon) and I'm mighty looking forward to getting home to my family!&lt;/p&gt;

EclipseCon 2007: Day 2
</title>
<description>
&lt;p&gt;Now, the second day of EclipseCon 2007 is over. Much lessons heard and much foot eat. Was really a great day that ended in enlightened mind and hurting feet. In the morning I wanted to attend the &lt;a href='http://www.eclipsecon.org/2007/index.php?page=sub/&amp;id=3762'&gt;Equinox&lt;/a&gt; session but the room was so crowded that I couldn't even get some space standing. Seems like a lot of folks is interested in using Eclipse technology on the server side. Never mind. So I went to a &lt;a href='http://www.eclipsecon.org/2007/index.php?page=sub/&amp;id=3925'&gt;BIRT&lt;/a&gt; talk next door which probably a good idea. Jason introduced new features of the Reporting Framework in a very refreshing and easily understandable way. I looked into BIRT in early 2005, back then I decided not to use it for our &lt;a href='http://cms.agynamix.de/agynamix-net-herald-3.html'&gt;Net-Herald&lt;/a&gt; RCP application. But with the new features that where introduced during the course of the last year or so it makes a very competitive option to JFreeReport which I use now. Especially the Report Designer is very powerful. Using the BIRT approach we now have a chance to give our users the chance to create or change reports themselfs (with some training). It will sure take some time until BIRT makes it into &lt;a href='http://cms.agynamix.de/agynamix-net-herald-3.html'&gt;Net-Herald&lt;/a&gt; since it's no &amp;#35;1 priority but it's an item on my list of future items. After that there was a &lt;a href='http://www.eclipsecon.org/2007/index.php?page=sub/&amp;id=3855'&gt;Mylar&lt;/a&gt; session. For those you don't know: Mylar adds task focused programming toEclipse. It fades out things you're not interested at the moment and help you concentrate on the tasks at hand. It integrates with CVS, SVN, Bugzilla, Jira or Trac (others to come) to help link your code to bugs in the database. &lt;a href='/img/uploads/2007/03/img_1704.png &quot;img_1704.png&quot;'&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/uploads/2007/03/img_1704.png&quot; alt=&quot;img&amp;#95;1704.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; After lunch we had a talk about the Eclipse &lt;a href='http://www.eclipsecon.org/2007/index.php?page=sub/&amp;id=3743'&gt;Data Binding Framework&lt;/a&gt;. I wrote about this &lt;a href='http://blog.agynamix.de/?p=79'&gt;yesterday&lt;/a&gt;. The Framework bascially helps you to wire your model against the user interface or any other part of your application. It then synchronizes the wired parts whenever data in the other part changes. It also supports validators to be hooked up in the middle. One could probably compare it with for instances the JGoodies binding framework although it is said to be more flexible (and harder to learn). &lt;a href='/img/uploads/2007/03/img_1724.png &quot;img_1724.png&quot;'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/uploads/2007/03/img_1724.png&quot; alt=&quot;img&amp;#95;1724.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The exhibitor's reception where the delicious part of the day. Indian and mexican food, green stuff, a chocolate fountain and a lot of coffee, bear and wine. Yammi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href='/img/uploads/2007/03/img_1712.png &quot;img_1712.png&quot;'&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/uploads/2007/03/img_1712.png&quot; alt=&quot;img&amp;#95;1712.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

EclipseCon 2007: Day 1
</title>
<description>
&lt;p&gt;Today was the first day at the EclipseCon. Actually it was Tutorial Day- the conference's sessions start tomorrow. &lt;a href='/img/uploads/2007/03/img_1693a.jpg &quot;img_1693a.jpg&quot;'&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/uploads/2007/03/img_1693a.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;img&amp;#95;1693a.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; There where already a lot of people there (the lunch room was filled)- there will probably be a lot more there tomorrow. Since in Net-Herald we use RCP technology I choose my tutorials accordingly. First there was &quot;&lt;a href='http://www.eclipsecon.org/2007/index.php?page=sub/&amp;id=3648'&gt;Creating Enterprise Business Applications Using Eclipse RCP&lt;/a&gt;&quot; which was basically a case study about an RCP application with local persistence (when offline) and a J2EE server. Very interesting where some comments about the possibilities one has to relatively easily change Eclipse's look &amp; feel. Scott Delap &lt;a href='http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/edu/os-dw-os-eclipse-rcp1.html'&gt;wrote an article&lt;/a&gt; about this at DeveloperWorks. Another interesting part was the introduction of the JFace Data Binding framework which actually is a middleware between UI and Model objects. &lt;a href='http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/library/os-ecl-jfacedb1/'&gt;Scott wrote a 2 part article about this&lt;/a&gt;, too. &lt;a href='/img/uploads/2007/03/img_1698.jpg &quot;img_1698.jpg&quot;'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/uploads/2007/03/img_1698.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;img&amp;#95;1698.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next was an introduction of the &lt;a href='http://www.eclipsecon.org/2007/index.php?page=sub/&amp;id=3655'&gt;Eclipe Intro Framework&lt;/a&gt;. The topic itself is somehow hard to grasp. Or maybe I had the impression because the session was right after the lunch... The next I remember was me sitting in the &lt;a href='http://www.eclipsecon.org/2007/index.php?page=sub/&amp;id=3664'&gt;UI Forms tutorial&lt;/a&gt;. Now this one was really interesting. The changes made in Eclipse 3.3 where discussed as well as the overall approach of the UI Forms framework. I haven't really looked into UI Forms before so I can't really tell what's new and what's not. But the tutorial did a great deal to pace the way for incorporating it into own apps. Now for instance there is a validation framework which is open to be used by clients. Whenever there is wrong (or no) data in a field, an indicator is displayed next to the field and the header shows a summary error message. When hovering over the error icons or clicking on them the error messages (which of course must be provided by the client) are shown. I'm planning to integrate the UI forms framework and use it as the basis for most non-modal dialogs. Now I planned this before the tutorial, that's why I choose it :) After all, this was a very interesting day- me being the first time at the EclipseCon. Let's see where all this leads to...&lt;/p&gt;

I'll be at EclipseCon 2007
</title>
<description>
&lt;p&gt;This year I decided it's time to learn something more about the main field I'm working in- Eclipse. So I registered for EclipseCon 2007 in Santa Clara and will be there all the way from Monday till Thursday. &lt;a href='/img/uploads/2007/03/img_1607.png &quot;Some fun before EclipseCon&quot;'&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/uploads/2007/03/img_1607-150x150.png&quot; alt=&quot;Some fun before EclipseCon&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; I came a bit earlier to visit some &lt;a href='http://www.flickr.com/photos/littlevanities/ &quot;her pics at flickr&quot;'&gt;friend&lt;/a&gt; in Santa Barbara. California offers such a huge variety of landscape which I really love and enjoy. Today we took a trip to Lake Cachuma near Santa Barbara (the photo is taken close to the lake). Tomorrow I'll be driving (&lt;a href='/img/uploads/2007/03/img_1570.png &quot;My car&quot;'&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/uploads/2007/03/img_1570-150x150.png&quot; alt=&quot;My car&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; ) up north on Highway one to see more of the beautiful cost line in the area. I might go up until Redwood Forest (just north of San Francisco), and then on Sunday go back to Santa Clara to prepare for the conference. I'm mainly interested in Eclipse RCP and RSP (Rich Server Platform) development because the is what I'm currently doing. Eclipse offers so much to support developers- problem is to know all that stuff; and to stay up to date with all those projects that open up on the Eclipse.org website almost every day. For my own software &lt;a href='http://cms.agynamix.de/agynamix-net-herald.html &quot;Net-Herald product page&quot;'&gt;Net-Herald&lt;/a&gt; I'm trying to learn about the use of Eclipse on the server side. I'd like to build a server platform that is easily installed by the user itself and is updateable with requiring complicated steps. Eclipse offers a lot in this area but I still know too little to make a decision. I hope I can find someone there who can shed a bit light on this matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href='/img/uploads/2007/03/img_1600.png &quot;Landscape&quot;'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href='/img/uploads/2007/03/img_1600.png &quot;Landscape&quot;'&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/uploads/2007/03/img_1600-150x150.png&quot; alt=&quot;Landscape&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'll try to post an article each night after the conference day to report shortly about the sessions I have attended (that helps me to not forget too easily :) ) as well as the general feeling there at the conference. I need to stop now- my friend's preparing chinese dinner which smells already really delicious...&lt;/p&gt;

Dopus 0.9.7 released
</title>
<description>
&lt;p&gt;From the release notes (also a docbook document transformed while packaging Dopus):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Version 0.9.7&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Property substitution in Docbook documents: The separator can be adjusted in build.properties (or overwritten in localbuild.properties if you want to have different separators in your files). This mechanism is disabled by default, to enable, set 'substitute.properties=yes' in your build.properties file (or localbuild.properties)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Linebreak support in html based and fo customization layers: Just type &amp;lt; ?lb ?&amp;gt; which will result in a line at the resulting position.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Added target &quot;manpages&quot;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Added target &quot;wordml&quot;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You can now have multiple documents within a document directory. To process documents other then the master document (same name as the doc dir): &lt;code&gt;generator.bat fluff pdf subfluff&lt;/code&gt; If the 3rd parameter is omitted the document is assumed to be of the same name as the documents directory (e.g. fluff.xml for a document directory named &quot;fluff&quot; (as usual).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of version 0.9.6 there is a version with JRE (Windows) and one without. Enjoy! Torsten.&lt;/p&gt;

Dopus (0.9.6) available with and without JRE
</title>
<description>
&lt;p&gt;Dopus as been enhanced again. It now includes a &quot;ReleaseNotes&quot; document that tracks changes. Amongst others there are now two versions available, one with JRE, one without. So if you are on Mac or Unix or already have a Windows JRE installed you can save yourself some bandwidth and download the significantly smaller version. Changes include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Support for HTTP proxy if you are behind a firewall&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Support for multiple Docbook DTD's. Version 4.4 and 4.5 are included, 4.5 is the default now&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Resolved some problems with Javahelp generation. The document is now indexed and the index is included in Javahelp. Also there was a problem when Docbook titles contained &quot;emphasis&quot; tags.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Happy downloading...&lt;/p&gt;

Dopus 0.9.4 out the door
</title>
<description>
&lt;p&gt;I have released Dopus version 0.9.4 today. This is a minor bug fix release which cures the following issues:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;MacOS X and Unix systems that don't define JAVA&amp;#95;HOME by default: the generator.sh script will search for 'java' by issuing the command 'which java'. If a Java is found it is used otherwise an error message is printed&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Path names with spaces are now supported on Windows and Unix systems.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have received some enhancement requests and will include them as time permits. Specifically these are:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Support for multiple Docbook DTD versions&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Support for variable substitution in Docbook documents. I want to be able to write '${document.version}' in a document and have the build engine replace that key with the value stored in one of the build property files. This way you can use all variables known to Ant in your document or define new ones in localbuild.properties.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Till next time...&lt;/p&gt;

Dopus 0.9.1 is out
</title>
<description>
&lt;p&gt;I've released a new version of Dopus (Docbook Publishing System) today. New features include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've put together a User Manual which is included as Docbook source and PDF. So the manual itself is an example for using Dopus.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've changed the stylesheet and XML encodings to UTF-8 which is more international then ISO-8859-1.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile I've created a &lt;a href='http://issues.agynamix.de/default.php?dopus'&gt;Dopus forum&lt;/a&gt; and a project in &lt;a href='http://issues.agynamix.de/default.php?pg=pgPublicEdit'&gt;our FogBugz bug tracker&lt;/a&gt;. Feel free to download the latest version from the freeware section of &lt;a href='http://cms.agynamix.de/downloads/index.php'&gt;our download area&lt;/a&gt; and enjoy it. For future versions I have planned:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Add plain text to the available file types. That would enable you to create a ChangeLog or ToDo document from a Docbook file&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Variable substitution: Make all variables from the build process available to the Docbook file. In the Docbook file then I would substitute '${variable.name}' against it's value. One can of course add it's own variables (Ant properties) to the build process and use them in the Docbook document. So when I change the property 'document.version' I want that same version be printed in the document.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

Dopus: New Docbook Publishing Framework
</title>
<description>
&lt;p&gt;During a project with T-Systems Germany we've created a new Docbook toolchain which is easy to use under Windows or Unix systems. T-Systems was kind enough to allow us to distribute the system under an Open Source license so others can use and profit from it. Dopus (the name of our new babe) is based on Java components and glued together using Apache Ant. It come preconfigured with all needed software components (including the Java JRE). On Windows, just unpack the thing into a directory of your choice. Then open a cmd shell, cd into the Dopus directory and type: &lt;em&gt;generator.bat fluff create book&lt;/em&gt; This will create a new directory &lt;em&gt;documents/fluff&lt;/em&gt; which contains a Docbook book template. To create PDF, just type &lt;em&gt;generator.bat fluff pdf&lt;/em&gt;. The resulting PDF can be found in &lt;em&gt;documents/fluff/output/pdf&lt;/em&gt;. Other available targets are:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;html : create chunked html&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;singlehtml: create a single page html file&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;htmlhelp: create a Windows Help (CHM) file&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;eclipse: create an Eclipse Help plugin (together with toc.xml and plugin.xml)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;javahelp: Create a Jar file containing the help suitable to view with JavaHelp&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;pdf: Create a PDF document&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;validate: Validate the input docbook file&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;distribute: export the Docbook input files into a ZIP archive&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dopus can be downloaded in the freeware section of our &lt;a href='http://cms.agynamix.de/downloads/index.php'&gt;download area&lt;/a&gt;. I've set up a discussion group for Dopus &lt;a href='http://issues.agynamix.de/default.php?dopus'&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Feel free to download and tell me what you think!&lt;/p&gt;

Our new website is up and running
</title>
<description>
&lt;p&gt;I invite you to look at our &lt;a href='http://www.agynamix.de'&gt;brand new internet presentation&lt;/a&gt;. I much more like the look compared to &lt;a href='http://www.agynamix.de/cms/'&gt;our old one&lt;/a&gt;. I'm not quiet satified though with the link rewriting module we use in our Joomla site. But this one (404SEF) was the only one working together with Joomla's Joom!Fish translation component (OpenSEF does not at the moment). It was not an option for me to set up two separate sites anyway. In the future I think we're gonna be heading the Typo3 way. Typo3 is a very complex CMS system yet it yields capabilities unmatched by others (that I know). One way to stay ahead of competition is to utilize the more complex yet more powerful tools. It is very easy to set up a Joomla CMS (creating a great Layout is far more difficult). It is much harder to set up Typo3. I've done this a while ago (with Typo3 V3) and it was struggling me against technology. I don't know if I wan, though :) I've set up a test system but the whole process was pretty tiring. Anyway, Typo3 V4 is said to be much more intuitive to use. So, let's check again. Let me know if you like our page and what you think could be improved (of course there is room for improvement).&lt;/p&gt;

Images with Windows Live Writer
</title>
<description>
&lt;p&gt;Using Wordpress 2 as our blogging tool, I'd like to be able to set up MS Live Writer in a way that it can upload images to Wordpress' upload directory via FTP. This is a test for this: &lt;a href='http://blog.agynamix.de/wp-content/uploads/ImageswithWindowsLiveWriter_F340/Sonnenuntergang1.jpg'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href='http://blog.agynamix.de/wp-content/uploads/ImageswithWindowsLiveWriter_F340/Sonnenuntergang9.jpg'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://blog.agynamix.de/wp-content/uploads/ImageswithWindowsLiveWriter_F340/Sonnenuntergang_thumb7.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wow, it seems to work... To make this entry at least a tiny bit useful, I should probably write about the settings I've used:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;I choose Weblog =&amp;gt; Edit Weblog Setttings and clicked &quot;Upload images to an FTP server&quot;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There you enter the address of your ftp server (probably the same as your blog's address, www.agynamix.de in my case), username and password.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Inside the Wordpress installation is a folder called &quot;uploads&quot; where Wordpress stores images that you upload through the web interface. Find out the complete path (not URL) of that directory (type 'pwd' if you're on a Unix box).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In the last filed type the URL of the &quot;uploads&quot; folder, http://blog.agynamix.de/wp-content/uploads in our case.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;You're done! Live Writer will upload the image into a self created directory (check that your ftp user has permission to create directories in &quot;uploads&quot;) and put a link into your blog entry. Cool.&lt;/p&gt;

Windows Live Writer Beta available
</title>
<description>
&lt;p&gt;MS has released a Beta version of Live Writer, a blog writing software for Windows (and .Net). &lt;a href='http://windowslivewriter.spaces.live.com/PersonalSpace.aspx?_c02_owner=1'&gt;This&lt;/a&gt; is the blog entry that contains the download link.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cool thing is it does not only work with MS' own blogging service but also with Wordpress (for instance) which I'm using. Now if this post appears you know it's working :)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Installation was very easy. You need an installed .Net runtime. I didn't check if 1.1 is enough- I have a 2.0 running on my machine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I started the msi installed- that asked for the website of my blog, user and password- everything else was done automatically. It detected the type of blog (wordpress), downloaded adapter software and here I am- writing my first blog entry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I didn't yet check how to include images- that's for next...&lt;/p&gt;

How to migrate your Thunderbird mail to Outlook
</title>
<description>
&lt;p&gt;Now, Thunderbird is a wonderful email client. I like it. I really do! For instance there is that nifty little feature which let's you edit a sent mail as if it were brand new. Cool. But in a corporate environment where everybody else is exchanging contacts, appointments and other PIM data via Outlook it's just uncool to open you vcard files with an ordinary editor. So I decided to jump upon the Outlook wagon. But I didn't want to loose my Thunderbird mail archive which keeps mails of my different projects as reference points. The problem however is that Outlook can't directly import mail from Thunderbird, only from Eudora and Outlook Express. Outlook Express in turn can import from older versions of Netscape Communicator, but not from Thunderbird. But I wouldn't write this entry if I didn't succeed. So here's what I did:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;I installed Netscape Communicator 4.78 (&lt;a href='http://download.freenet.de/download.php?file_id=3745&amp;download=Netscape%20Communicator'&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;) and created an email account in Netscape Messenger. After that I closed the Messenger&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Netscape put my user data into C:&amp;#92;Programme&amp;#92;Netscape&amp;#92;Users&amp;#92;tuhlmann. Within that directory there is a folder called 'Mail'. Rename it and create a new folder 'Mail'.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Copy the content of Thunderbirds 'Local Folders' directory into this 'Mail' dir. Thunderbird usually stores it's profiles under C:&amp;#92;Dokumente und Einstellungen&amp;#92;&amp;#92;Anwendungsdaten&amp;#92;Thunderbird. Of course on an english windows the names would differ.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;After copying the tree remove all the .msf files (in the new location, not on Thunderbird's side)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Then start Netscape Messenger. You should now see all your mails and folders. Highlight all folders and choose File-&amp;gt;Compress. This will create Netscapes old index. After that close Netscape again.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Then start Outlook Express and create a mail account there. Then say Import from Netscape Communicator and choose the 'Mail' directory of Netscape Messenger. The import should begin now. In the end all your mails should now be available from Outlook Express. Now you close Outlook Express&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Last step: Start Outlook and create- yep, you guessed it- a mail account. No import your mail from Outlook Express. In the end, all your mail is available from Outlook (I used Outlook 2003 here but I guess it will work with older versions, too.).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;You still have to recreate all filters. And I did not look into migrating the spam filter training data. Maybe this is a product idea: Create a mail tool migrator which can migrate form/to different mail systems... I hope this little howto will be useful for someone...&lt;/p&gt;

Dependent so much
</title>
<description>
&lt;p&gt;At the point when hardware fails to function you know what you miss. It's not just the backup. You loose precious time. From one of my customers I got a company notebook to be able to work in his corporate intranet and access all needed servers. Without it I can develop with pen and paper. This notebook is a HP/Compaq NC8000 with Win2000 on it- it worked very reliably over the last years. On Monday I put it into standby mode. When I tried to start it yesterday the fan was on for about 10 seconds, the LED with the flash symbol came up (I never saw this one, I thought it was broken :) ) and nothing more happened. Just imagin a deadline within the next 3 days and you know about my feelings. I removed the battery and tried various combinations to breath live back into this dead piece of silicon and plastic. Nothing worked. So in a very sad mood I went to the technicians of that company. They repeated the exact same sequence of trial starts- with battery only, with battery and wire and finally wire only. This one brought it back to life! That's unfair, I thought. I felt a bit stupid. But anyway, I was very happy to be able to continue my work. Until today. While in a &lt;a href='http://www.vmware.com/products/player/'&gt;VM Player&lt;/a&gt; session and hacking some fancy perl stuff suddenly the display went black and nothing happened anymore. Same as yesterday. With the exception that I did not yet get the machine back to life. So I'm blogging... I try again tonight, maybe it's a temperature problem. Or maybe a disk thing? All I hope is to get my data back. And of course there is no backup for desktop clients within that corporate intranet. For our own machines we use &lt;a href='http://www.bacula.org/'&gt;bacula&lt;/a&gt; to backup Windows clients as well as Linux servers. This works great. But only for our machines :( I wish you a great day anyway!&lt;/p&gt;

Trixbox is our phone system now
</title>
<description>
&lt;p&gt;For quite a while we run a AMD 64 server with nearly all the services on it that we need- or think we might need :) There is &lt;a href='http://subversion.tigris.org/'&gt;Subversion&lt;/a&gt; hosting our code repository, neatly serving via https and WebDav. Then we have played with &lt;a href='http://www.open-xchange.org/'&gt;Open-Xchange&lt;/a&gt; as our groupware and exchanged it with &lt;a href='http://www.sugarcrm.com/'&gt;SugarCRM&lt;/a&gt;. And besides a lot of other stuff it was running a self compiled version of &lt;a href='http://www.asterisk.org/'&gt;Asterisk&lt;/a&gt; using VoIP as well as an old Fitz AVM pci card for ISDN support. I have now decided that it is bad to care for everything. In the beginning we evaluated Asterisk and VoIP as a possible market niche for us but decided that this is not our part. Now what do you do if you like the technology, want to benefit from new ways of communication but simply cannot afford to learn the details of a technology let alone maintaining it. Yep, you stand upon the shoulder of others. You can do this by buying another company's product or use available open source. &lt;a href='http://www.trixbox.org'&gt;Trixbox&lt;/a&gt; is the successor of Asterisk@Home, a Linux distribution based upon CentOS 4.3 (CentOS is binary compatible with Redhat Enterprise Edition) and bundled with useful modules that make it easy to use. For instance you have FreePBX which is a web based admin application for Asterisk. You can download the latest ISO from their website. My greates problem was getting my ISDN card to play with it. I first tried a HFC (Cologne chipset) based one- these are easiest to install by typing &quot;install-ZAPHFC&quot;- did compile but asterisk did not start anymore. I then tried a Fritz AVM card using capi-utils and chan&amp;#95;capi for Asterisk. Did compile and install but strangely locked the machine :( After helping Google to make more money I finally found the reason the HFC card messed up Asterisk- there is a module &quot;app&amp;#95;trunkisavail.so&quot; in the Asterisk modules directory. Remove it (or rename it) and the problem is gone. Go figure :) Anyway, now it's working with a HFC card. The sound seems to be better then with the capi card. We're running the Trixbox on a Celeron Mobile processor to save the planet- or our pockets. We use an ASUS board together with a adapter socket to plug the mobile processor on the standard board. Up to now this works like a charm and it should save us a considerable amount of energy. Btw, yesterday I got my Microsoft Partner pack which included a Vista beta DVD. But since we're running our telephone system on that mobile pc there is none left to test out vista :(&lt;/p&gt;

Eclipse GEF and transparent images
</title>
<description>
&lt;p&gt;Well then, the other day I tried to improve the appearance of &lt;a href='http://net-herald.agynamix.de'&gt;Net-Herald&lt;/a&gt;, our monitoring and controlling application (&lt;a href='http://www.agynamix.de/cms/index.php?option=content&amp;task=view&amp;id=13⟨=en'&gt;video here&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;a href='/img/uploads/2006/07/gef_overview.jpg &quot;Overview&quot;'&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/uploads/2006/07/gef_overview.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Overview&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; In the overview you see the result of this adventure. I have set a background image (the clouds) to make the look more attractive. The user can insert any image (texture, a country map, a technical plan) to merge with the shown elements. The image is drawn in the root element of the GEF diagram (condensed view): protected IFigure createFigure() { Figure f = new FreeformLayer() { @Override protected void paintFigure(Graphics graphics) { Image img = getCastedModel().getImage(); if (img != null) { graphics.drawImage(img, 0, 0); } else { super.paintFigure(graphics); } } }; f.setOpaque(false); f.setBorder(new MarginBorder(3)); f.setLayoutManager(new FreeformLayout()); return f; } The FreeformLayer does not support background images by itself, but this little adaption does the trick. Now, the next problem was the shown elements- they didn't like to be drawn transparently. Even the setOpaque() method could not help: &lt;a href='/img/uploads/2006/07/gef_opaque.jpg &quot;Opaque&quot;'&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href='/img/uploads/2006/07/gef_opaque.jpg &quot;Opaque&quot;'&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/uploads/2006/07/gef_opaque.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Opaque&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now I took my new learned knowledge about adapting the paintFigure() method and thought about drawing a 1 pixel transparent gif as background of my element. I subclassed Panel() which I use as a container for the element's figures (file attached). Voila! &lt;a href='/img/uploads/2006/07/gef_transparent.jpg &quot;Transparent&quot;'&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/uploads/2006/07/gef_transparent.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Transparent&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; The 1 pixel image is scaled over the whole background of the element and GEF knows how to (not) display it... Moral: Make the user happy :) &lt;span id=&quot;p56&quot;&gt;&lt;a href='/img/uploads/2006/07/TransparentPanel.zip'&gt;Class TransparentPanel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Migrating from Eclipse 3.1 to 3.2
</title>
<description>
&lt;p&gt;I thought this would be kind of easy. After 3 hours I know there is nothing that is really easy in software development. I'm developing a Client Server application with an Eclipse RCP Client. Now I wanted to update the Eclipse libs I use for the client from 3.1 to the newly arrived 3.2. I also use &lt;a href='http://www.eclipse.org/gef/'&gt;GEF&lt;/a&gt; in my application, this was one reason for the update, the other one being the &lt;a href='http://www.eclipse.org/articles/Article-Tabbed-Properties/tabbed_properties_view.html'&gt;really cool tabbed property dialogs&lt;/a&gt;. So I edited my Target platform (you should really seperate the Eclipse which you might use to develop your application from the Eclipse which IS your application). After cleaning all projects and shutting down the IDE I was still not able to start my application again. Fancy error messages like &quot;no product id found&quot; or &quot;Bundle ... not resolved&quot; would occur in the log. I then tried to create a sample RCP project. I could create it but it would not start for the same reasons mine would not start. Hm, okay then. I exported my preferences, saved the Eclipse .metadata directory and started from scratch. I then imported my settings and tried the example aplication again. Voila! Cool, easy migration path :) Sure enough, my RCP client would start like a rocket in this new environment. So I wasted half a day just to find out it was not my fault but an old .metadata repository. Moral of the story: It's not always your fault :)&lt;/p&gt;

<title>
Our Business Model
</title>
<description>
&lt;p&gt;During the last couple of days I was reading over at the &lt;a href='http://discuss.joelonsoftware.com/default.asp?pg=pgDiscussTopics&amp;ixDiscussGroup=5'&gt;Business of Software&lt;/a&gt; forum discussions about keeping your day job or not and other strategies to start your mISV. I thought you might be interested in the way we did it. I admit I made mistakes which could have been avoided had I known the business side of a mISV better. Before I started in April 2005 I was employed with a big german consulting company. I very much liked the team I was in and mostly liked my projects. I came to know that bad management can really destroy a yelling team and that most of the upper management do not know Fred Brooks book &quot;&lt;a href='http://www.amazon.de/exec/obidos/ASIN/0201835959/qid=1150293965/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i1_xgl/302-7597712-0273655'&gt;The mythical man month&lt;/a&gt;&quot; (which says it doesn't help to add people to a late project). Anyway this was my situation when I started my venture. I &lt;a href='http://blog.agynamix.de/?p=38'&gt;already posted&lt;/a&gt; about believing that this is my calling, you can jump there if you are interested. First I started to negotiate with my employer about working part time for him and part time for my own business. They didn't let me. So I quit. In the end I didn't want to test it or try out this new life- I wanted to go for it faithfully. About this time a friend of mine who owns an &lt;a href='http://www.rdelectronic.de/html_en/index_en.htm'&gt;electronic company&lt;/a&gt; approached me and we talked about the idea of writing a monitoring and controlling application which would work with his electronic. This electronic is already introduced in the market and people like it pretty much so I thought it would give me a good start. Ha! The software is rather complex (Client, Server, Database, connectors to Jabber service and SMS etc.). A year ago (no, actually it was more than a year) we introduced the software to a prospective customer. After some meetings and a lot of talking they decided they want the software (also because I offered it at a very competitive price in the hope to get a first reference). First time they wanted it was October last year. They still want it but they had a few more concerns. Anyway, we are now going into the final stage of the sales process. But I learned it is not really wise to sell to laggards first :) The problem in this market domain (public water supply) is that there are probably no early adopters which would help to introduce the product. Lesson: Please look carefully at the domain for which you develop a solution. Get to know their mentality. Now the other thing I did very naively was to hire two employees half a year after starting. I never had a lot of patience anyway, but you should not do this! I &lt;em&gt;thought&lt;/em&gt; selling or software would start faster but I was wrong. So if you employ, do this after you have a strong need. Carefully decide if you want to hire some other company to do work which you cannot do (web design, graphics, for instance) or if you employ someone. Now I don't say the guys I hired are bad in there jobs, the opposite is true. But still I have to pay them every month. How? Well, now we come to the point, how we do business: I didn't have much savings. It might have lasted for 3 month to support my family of four. Not much of a backup strategy :) My old company approached me a few month after I quit and asked if I could work as a freelancer for them. I accepted gladly and since May last year there is a steady flow of work from this company to me. Alternatively I let my employees reach out into new territory. We develop web sites, web shops, marketing material, or do hardware maintanance contracts. This is a great way to learn about the specific needs of customers from different domains, traveling agencies, lawyer, health care, etc. I feel it is very important to have a very close relationship to your customers or potential customers. If your customers tell you about their problems they have done a great deal of market research for you! We have also tried many different ways in the past before finding our identity (or at least, coming near it). We did Linux consulting, VoIP, Media Center PC, very different kinds of stuff. We wasted a lot of time trying things and finding that they are not ours. I simply didn't believe in them too strongly. But I guess one has to go some wrong ways to see the right one. Our true identity is as a software development company. We also want to keep a very close relationship to the multitude of small companies around us. Have an open ear for their problems and find ways to help them with our software writing skills. So that's us. When I look back I would not want to miss this time although it was and still is very hard. It is a very unique way of life. It is like having another child :) Lesson: Please read a bit of business theory before you stumble in. It surely will not hurt! Torsten.&lt;/p&gt;

Tag your Outlook messages
</title>
<description>
&lt;p&gt;I'm beta testing a new add on product for MS Outlook™. Its called &lt;a href='http://www.taglocity.com/'&gt;Taglocity&lt;/a&gt; and allows you to tag your Outlook messages. So no matter what folder a message is in you can assign multiple tags (or call them label or category) to a message. &lt;a href='/img/uploads/2006/06/taglocity.png &quot;taglocity.png&quot;'&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/uploads/2006/06/taglocity-150x150.png&quot; alt=&quot;taglocity.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; There is a TagCloud which shows your available tags whereby the size of the font displays the amount of elements associated with the word. You can easily filter for combined tag names, save searches etc. Oh yes, and it supports AutoTagging (it learns) so it tries to take some pain away from you... You can even send your tags embedded in a mail. If the recipient uses Taglocity as well then the original tagging is preserved. I'm using this for just a few days but I find it's a very useful addition. At least I have looked for some way to virtually bundle messages together no matter which folder they're in. For instance, if you receive a message for a project which you need to answer within a given time frame, you can tag the message with the project name as well as something like &quot;Answer this week&quot;. You can then QuickFind all messages tagged with &quot;Answer this week&quot; and get hopefully less phone calls of people mad at you because you didn't answer their important mails.&lt;/p&gt;

Check out Evernote
</title>
<description>
&lt;p&gt;I'm about to (again) check out &lt;a href='http://www.evernote.com'&gt;Evernote&lt;/a&gt;, a program not unlike MS OneNote. Evernote is availabl ein a free and a Plus edition. &lt;span id=&quot;p44&quot;&gt;&lt;a href='http://blog.agynamix.de//?attachment_id=44 &quot;Evernote&quot;'&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/uploads/2006/05/EN-screenshot-104-front.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Evernote&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Basically it lets you store all kinds of notes in one scroll. It offers a time band, manual categories (which you can attach to notes) or it can aoutomatically categorize stuff. One interesting feature is the ability to create templates for notes. For instance there is a ToDo template, ToDo With Date, Shopping List or Phone Message. It comes with a FireFox plugin (if you use the latest FireFox you need to download the plugin from their website, the one included in the installer is for older versions) that makes it a snap to grab a whole website or just a part of it and make it part of your Evernote scroll. Cool Software!&lt;/p&gt;

Getting Things Done (again)
</title>
<description>
&lt;p&gt;If you have too many projects hanging or stacking on your desk &lt;a href='http://safarisoftware.typepad.com/mlp_developer_news/gtd/index.html'&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt; by Bob Walsh might be of interest for you. He's describing an algorithm to regain focus on the task at hand and not to spread your focus over multiple projects at once. Currently I'm again reading &lt;a href='http://www.amazon.de/exec/obidos/ASIN/0142000280/qid=1147787030/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i1_xgl/302-7597712-0273655'&gt;David Allen's &quot;Getting Things Done&quot;&lt;/a&gt;. It's not an easy lecture for me but well worth it's time. If you graduate from a &quot;mere&quot; developer (geek) into an entrepreneur all of a sudden a lot more things are in your responsibility. Things you never knew they existed. You need a good mechanism to deal with all those things. GTD (Getting Things Done) is one way.&lt;/p&gt;

Being Authentic
</title>
<description>
&lt;p&gt;As we go along in our adventure to create a software development company, one of the most important steps for us is to find our identity. That one is crucial as it defines our company's strategy, the things we do or don't. &lt;img src=&quot;/img/uploads/2006/05/IMG_0999.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;IMG&amp;#95;0999.JPG&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the last couple of month I neglected the true source of our identity. What we have done was basically looking at our own strength and weeknesses and figuring out the products and services we can offer our customers. There are indeed a lot of very diverse gift's assembled under the AGYNAMIX roof- yet that's not the source of our identity. You see I wholeheartely believe that our creator in heaven has a divine plan with each one of us. He told us through his word, the Bible, that long before you were born he created a unique plan for your life. Something no one else can fit in, something special to you and you alone. Now two years ago around this time God started to speak to me about founding a company. I left my good paid job and great colleges I had there to be obedient. It's not that God would have forced me to do something I don't want. There was always a bit of a desire within me to start a business. Around 2000 with the .com hype I was considering this with a bit more seriousness. But I didn't jump. Fear of the unknown? I don't know. Now I know I was not ready back then. And it wasn't the right timing. But this time, during October 2004 I slowly started this adventure. Then in March 2005 I left my old company (originally I had planned to leave in December but they have asked me to stay for an important project) and started to develop the first full blown application of my new microISV. So to summarize a bit: I believe God has called me into this business. I believe it is part of his divine plan for my live and the live's it will affect. Yet until now I have tried to hide God from the public. Maybe because it is not politically correct, maybe because everyone else I know does it, maybe of fear of the consequences. Probably a mix of all of them. &lt;img src=&quot;/img/uploads/2006/05/Img0026.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;Img0026.JPG&quot; /&gt; Yesterday I believe God spoke to my heart saying: If you hide me in what I have given you, I will hide out! If you are not afraid of confessing me I will not be affraid of confessing you! So I officially chose to run this company under God's command. If we are successfull then this is not my fault! It's God's! And I'm willing to give him ALL the glory for a company success in times that are miserably appropriate to start a company from scratch (at least this is what it feels :) ). So this is what I want you to know, my dear reader. God has given us a lot of gifts. But those are just gifts. It's much better to work with the one who gives! Thank you for bearing with me, have a nice day!&lt;/p&gt;

A nice way to launch SWT applications
</title>
<description>
&lt;p&gt;SWT (the low level GUI toolkit used by Eclipse and a lot of other Java based apps) needs platform dependent libraries (.dll on Windows and .so on Unix). Normally you have to tell Java where it will find those libs. &lt;a href='http://www.eclipsezone.com/eclipse/forums/m92002519.html'&gt;This&lt;/a&gt; is another way to launch SWT applications without the need to set -Djava.library.path to Java or to put the libs into a system wide path. main() would look like this:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public static void main&amp;#40;String&amp;#91;&amp;#93; args&amp;#41; throws Exception { URL&amp;#91;&amp;#93; urls = ; File workDir = ; ClassLoader cl = new SWTClassLoader&amp;#40;urls, workDir&amp;#41;; Class mainClass = cl.loadClass&amp;#40;&amp;#41;; Method main = mainClass.getMethod&amp;#40;&amp;quot;main&amp;quot;, new Class&amp;#91;&amp;#93; { String&amp;#91;&amp;#93;.class }&amp;#41;; main.invoke&amp;#40;null, new Object&amp;#91;&amp;#93; { args }&amp;#41;; }&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;p36&quot;&gt;&lt;a href='/img/uploads/2006/04/SWTClassLoader.zip'&gt;SWTClassLoader&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Thanks to Peter Nehrer for this tip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't know why I did not install this earlier! The &lt;a href='https://www.zend.com/de/free_download/optimizer'&gt;Zend Optimizer&lt;/a&gt; (a free download) speeds up your php applicationsin a way working with them becomes smoother and more enjoyable! I have the impression it also speeds up our Java web applications :)&lt;/p&gt;

You could buy the book (&lt;a href='http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1591841003/104-5590314-9124745?n=283155'&gt;amazon.com&lt;/a&gt;) or watch the video which was recorded during a speach of Seth at Google. I must say I'm thankful for every marketing advice I can get. This is not something that comes lightly to software developers, yet it is so important. At least if you have to sell the stuff you produce :)&lt;/p&gt;

Find your identity
</title>
<description>
&lt;p&gt;Yes, that's pretty hard. At least for me. What is the purpose of my company? Whom will I server? What products or services do I want to create? During the last couple of weeks and even month we (we are 3) were looking for that identity. We've tried a whole lot of things. We've tried hardware, multimedia, hardware services. All kinds of stuff. And nothing really worked. I didn't feel comfortable entering these fields. I tell you (I don't even know you name! Or are there two of you out there reading this?) it hurts when you go through these processes. But I guess I have to. It cleanses. In the end you know what you're capable of and what not. You learn how to lead. Also it helps building up a real team. Not just a bunch of people. But devoted fellowes who know their part and their responsibilities and will do everything to make this adventure a success! I feel it comes to an end now. We've tried ourselves in different areas and found out the places we would not want to be. And also the places we want to be. I'm a software developer. I love creating applications that help people be more effective. I'm not a game programmer. I'm also not you're low level system driver specialist. My current focus is cross platform, database backed client server applications. We've done migration tools and other things that require a strong backend based functionality. Our current product, Net-Herald is a Java based, client server application (Eclipse RCP) that allows the monitoring of computer attached sensors in their display in a nice customizable graphical view (Eclipse GEF). But this product is still in its infancy. We are currently looking for a market for this product. I know- this is much too late. But you don't know how much you learn about business once you've started. But only after a while. And a lot you learn from your failures. So I admit it was definetly a failure to start development (I sums up to mabye 9 month by now) of a full blown application without proper investigation of the market! Learn from my mistakes! Don't do this! Well, at least we have one customer with which we develop the application (more or less), but of course that's not enough. So we are now looking for hardware vendors that develop monitoring hardware and try to partner with them to enlarge our market this way. So we found that &lt;a href='http://www.telic.de'&gt;vendor&lt;/a&gt; who is producing gsm terminals that can be triggered by either a phone call (which costs no money because only the phone number is used, no call is established) or from contacts that (triggered by an opening door for instance) cause the device to send a SMS. Our application receives the SMS, maps it to the monitored devices and displays it. It might send an alarm if something is wrong. So please tell me, dear reader, what else can be monitored. How can we change our product to make it of interest for more people. Or put it this way: Where do we find the market niche where our product fit's in? As you see, our quest for our own identity is not over yet. But I do believe that we will find our answers pretty soon. We have to find them pretty soon!&lt;/p&gt;

Finding a Great Product Idea
</title>
<description>
&lt;p&gt;One of the hardest things for me, a developer at heart, is thinking about marketing! Luckily there are Guys like &lt;a href='http://www.ericsink.com/ &quot;Eric Sink&quot;'&gt;Eric Sink&lt;/a&gt; who can provide a bridge between the software world and the marketing world. I'm currently reading his &lt;a href='http://software.ericsink.com/'&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt; and are very thankful for the insight tips he gives. One thing that struck me the most was how could I possibly find a good marketing idea which does not just sound great but is also happily accepted by customers. &lt;a href='http://software.ericsink.com/bos/Finding_Product_Idea.html &quot;Finding a Product Idea&quot;'&gt;Read&lt;/a&gt; about the tips he has to offer.&lt;/p&gt;

Evaluating a Java Workflow engine
</title>
<description>
&lt;p&gt;For the next version of our &lt;a href='http://www.agynamix.de/cms/index.php?option=content&amp;task=view&amp;id=13 &quot;Net-Herald Monitoring and Controlling&quot;'&gt;Net-Herald&lt;/a&gt; monitoring and controlling software I'm evaluating the different open source workflow solutions for Java. One can find long lists &lt;a href='http://java-source.net/open-source/workflow-engines &quot;Open-Source Java&quot;'&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href='http://www.manageability.org/blog/stuff/workflow_in_java/view &quot;Manageability Blog&quot;'&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. So far I'm tending to use &lt;a href='http://www.opensymphony.com/osworkflow/ &quot;OSWorkflow&quot;'&gt;OSWorkflow&lt;/a&gt; as it seems to be easily integrated into a non J2EE (yes, there are non J2EE Java applications) app. I'd like to use a workflow engine for the inner structure of the software. So that there is more after-deployment control what actions are taken whenever a signal from some observed device arrives. For instance the user wants to wait for a period of time until finally an alarm is fired. Or he wants to control a different device according to the received signal. Anyway, never mind :) Just loud thinking... Please leave your comments about this.&lt;/p&gt;

Installing Eclipse plugins the smart way
</title>
<description>
&lt;p&gt;I just came across this thorough description about how you can install additional Eclipse plugins without polluting your Eclipse root directory and even use them for multiple Eclipse installations. The article is &lt;a href='http://blog.exis.com/colin/archives/2004/12/23/managing-plugins-in-eclipse/trackback/ &quot;Installing Eclipse plugins the smart way&quot;'&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.

Integration between Asterisk PBX and the fantastic Open-Xchange
</title>
<description>
&lt;p&gt;We have created a small perl script that integrates OX with an Asterisk PBX. It uses Asterisk's Manager API which means OX and Asterisk can run on different machines. &lt;a href='/img/uploads/2006/04/OX_Click2Dial.jpg &quot;OX Click2Dial&quot;'&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/uploads/2006/04/OX_Click2Dial.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;OX Click2Dial&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Requirements:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;We use the OXSession.pm Perl Module described &lt;a href='http://www.open-xchange.org/oxwiki/Talking_20to_20the_20Sessiond_20with_20Perl'&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Copy it into a directory OXtensions in a path where perl will find it (we put it directly into the cgi-bin next to the click-2-dial script)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;!&amp;ndash; &amp;ndash;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;We use the following perl modules:&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;    use lib '/usr/lib/cgi-bin'; use CGI; use Net::Telnet &amp;#40;&amp;#41;; use Net::LDAP;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Step by Step instructions:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;on&amp;#95;the&amp;#95;asterisk&amp;#95;side:&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;On the Asterisk side:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;You need to include a user into Asterisk's manager.conf (/etc/asterisk in most cases):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;#91;axdial&amp;#93; secret = axdial deny=0.0.0.0/0.0.0.0 permit=127.0.0.1/255.255.255.255 read = system,call,log,verbose,command,agent,user write = system,call,log,verbose,command,agent,user&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;If your OX Server runs on a different host and with it the click-2-dial script you need to adjust the &lt;code&gt;permit=&lt;/code&gt; line. Also pick yourself a nice username (in square brackets) and secret.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;on&amp;#95;the&amp;#95;ox&amp;#95;side&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;On the OX side&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Open-Xchange guys were very smart and included some cool extension points into the groupware. For a detailed explanation please read &lt;a href='http://www.open-xchange.org/oxwiki/CommunicationSolutions'&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;. So in the file &lt;code&gt;intranet.conf&lt;/code&gt; you have several hooks you can activate. This has been tested with 0.8.2-RC3 but should work with 0.8.0-5 and above (as stated in the above document). ``&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$OX&amp;#95;HOME/etc/groupware/intranet.conf faxURL=http://server/?fax=$fax&amp;amp;name=$contact&amp;#95;name&amp;amp;uid=$user&amp;#95;uid&amp;amp; uid&amp;#95;pass=$user&amp;#95;pass&amp;amp;uid&amp;#95;name=$user&amp;#95;name phoneURL=https://&amp;#91;your-server&amp;#93;/cgi-bin/ax&amp;#95;asterisk.pl?session&amp;#95;id=$sessionid&amp;amp; to&amp;#95;call=$phone smsURL=https://&amp;#91;your-server&amp;#93;/cgi-bin/ax&amp;#95;asterisk.pl?session&amp;#95;id=$sessionid&amp;amp; to&amp;#95;call=$sms&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;# &amp;quot;true&amp;quot; uses webmail for sending a mail, &amp;quot;link&amp;quot; for external server # &amp;quot;false&amp;quot; makes nothing faxEnabled=link&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;You must set &lt;code&gt;faxEnabled=link&lt;/code&gt; in order to activate the links. You must activate all 3 of them or OX will throw a &lt;span class=&quot;twikiNewLink&quot;&gt;NullPointerException&lt;/span&gt; (0.8.2-RC3). Next you need to copy the perl script ax&amp;#95;asterisk.pl into your cgi-bin directory (usr/lib/cgi-bin und Debian/Ubuntu). Make sure Perl scripts can be executed as cgi scripts. Please open the script in an editor (vi) and check the variable section and the beginning of the script. In most cases you need to adjust them to your needs. The variables are explained in the script. The script will do the following:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Whenever there is a telephone number, mobile no or fax number OX will place the code behind ...URL in its place. This makes the phone number clickable. It will open a small popup window (at least on my machine &lt;img src=&quot;https://kaleb/twiki/pub/TWiki/SmiliesPlugin/smile.gif&quot; alt=&quot;smile&quot; title=&quot;smile&quot; /&gt; ) and display error messages there (in case there are any). If successful the window will close automatically. The script is called with the sessionID of the user that clicked and the number that should be dialed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The script will use OXSession to look into the given session and check if it's valid. If not you will see an error message&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It will then create an LDAP connection to read the user's 'Pager' number. This field must hold the internal extension number that Asterisk should call.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If it has collected all data without error it will use the Asterisk Manager to originate a call.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;After the user phone rings, the user picks up the phone and Asterisk will then dial the given number.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;I hope you find this script useful. Resources: &lt;span id=&quot;p33&quot;&gt;&lt;a href='/img/uploads/2006/04/ax_asterisk.zip'&gt;ax&amp;#95;asterisk.zip&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Nagios und Asterisk (Nagios lernt sprechen)
</title>
<description>
&lt;p&gt;Da wir ja bei uns eine &lt;a href='http://www.asterisk.org'&gt;Asterisk&lt;/a&gt;-Telefonanlage im Einsatz haben (Hint: wir verkaufen die auch!) und außerdem ein Nagios-Monitoringsystem (NMS: Network Management System), lag die Idee ja nahe, Nagios über Asterisk reden zu lassen. Dazu habe ich folgendes gemacht: Im Nagios ein neues Kommando notify-by-asterisk angelegt, dass im entsprechenden Kontakt angegeben wird. Das Kommando selbst ist recht simpel:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;# 'notify-by-asterisk' command definition define command{ command&amp;#95;name notify-by-asterisk command&amp;#95;line /usr/local/nagios/bin/asterisk&amp;#95;call.sh $NOTIFICATIONTYPE$ $SERVICEDESC$ $HOSTALIAS$ $SERVICESTATE$ $SERVICEOUTPUT$ }&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Das Skript asterisk&amp;#95;call.sh ist ein einfaches Shellskript, das zuerst einen Textstring erzeugt, diesen dann durch Festival jagt (erzeugt eine Wav-Datei) und anschließend eine Asterisk-Call-Datei erzeugt, die dann in das outgoing-Verzeichnis von Asterisk kopiert wird. Asterisk nimmt die Datei, generiert einen Anruf und spielt die wav-Datei ab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/uploads/2006/03/103-0391_img.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;103-0391&amp;#95;img.jpg&quot; title=&quot;103-0391_img.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Die Lösung funktioniert auf unserem System. Damit sie auch woanders läuft müssen noch ein paar Einstellungen vorgenommen werden:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;visudo ausführen: Der Nagios-User (bei mir: nagios) braucht das Recht, eine Datei als User www-data (unter dem läuft Asterisk bei mir. Ist der Web-User weil ich zusätzlich noch AMP im Einsatz habe und hier gibt es Rechtekonflikte, wenn AMP als Webapplikation nicht auf die Asteriskdateien zugreifen darf.) in das Asterisk outgoing-Verzeichnis (&lt;em&gt;/var/spool/asterisk/outgoing&lt;/em&gt;) zu dürfen:&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;nagios ALL = (www-data NOPASSWD:) /bin/cp&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Die Datei asterisk&amp;#95;call.sh anpassen und für nagios ausführbar in &lt;em&gt;/usr/local/nagios/bin&lt;/em&gt; (oder woanders, dann aber das Nagios-Kommando anpassen) zur Verfügung stellen:&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;!&amp;ndash; &amp;ndash;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;#!/bin/sh&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;NOTIFICATIONTYPE=$1 SERVICEDESC=$2 HOSTALIAS=$3 SERVICESTATE=$4 SERVICEOUTPUT=$5&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;OUT&amp;#95;STR=`/usr/bin/printf &amp;quot;%b&amp;quot; &amp;quot;This is the Nagios Monitoring System sending a \ $NOTIFICATIONTYPE notification. The Service $SERVICEDESC at host $HOSTALIAS \ is in state $SERVICESTATE. This is the service output: $SERVICEOUTPUT.&amp;quot;`&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;play&amp;#95;file=&amp;quot;/tmp/asterisk&amp;#95;nagios&amp;quot; bf=&amp;quot;$play&amp;#95;file.wav&amp;quot; cf=&amp;quot;$play&amp;#95;file.call&amp;quot; lf=&amp;quot;$play&amp;#95;file.log&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt; CHANNEL=&amp;quot;SIP/&amp;#40;peer&amp;#41;/&amp;#40;no to dial&amp;#41;&amp;quot; CALLER&amp;#95;ID=&amp;quot;Nagios &amp;quot; echo &amp;quot;$OUT&amp;#95;STR&amp;quot; &amp;gt; $lf echo &amp;quot;$OUT&amp;#95;STR&amp;quot; | /usr/bin/text2wave -scale 1.5 -F 8000 -o $bf echo &amp;quot;Channel: $CHANNEL&amp;quot; &amp;gt; $cf echo &amp;quot;WaitTime: 60&amp;quot; &amp;gt;&amp;gt; $cf echo &amp;quot;MaxRetries: 3&amp;quot; &amp;gt;&amp;gt; $cf echo &amp;quot;CallerId: $CALLER&amp;#95;ID&amp;quot; &amp;gt;&amp;gt; $cf echo &amp;quot;Application: Playback&amp;quot; &amp;gt;&amp;gt; $cf echo &amp;quot;Data: $play&amp;#95;file&amp;quot; &amp;gt;&amp;gt; $cf sudo -u www-data cp $cf /var/spool/asterisk/outgoing rm $cf&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Das wars. Festival ist nur als englische Version erhältlich (es gibt zwar deutsche Anpassungen, hab ich aber noch nicht ausprobiert), es gibt jedoch unter &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cepstral.com&quot;&gt;http://www.cepstral.com&lt;/a&gt; sehr gut klingende englische und deutsche Stimmen- die kosten so um die 30$. Viel Spaß.&lt;/p&gt;

Apache LDAP Authentifizierung und Open-Exchange
</title>
<description>
&lt;p&gt;Open-Exchange ist ja eine wunderbare Sache. Die schönste und am schwierigsten zu installierende Groupware, die mir bis jetzt untergekommen ist. Nun möchte ich gern unsere Subversion-Repositories über mod&amp;#95;svn zugänglich machen und zur Authentifizierung die LDAP-Daten nutzen, die Open-Exchange sowieso schon anlegt. Also:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;neue Gruppe &quot;developers&quot; angelegt mit addgroup&amp;#95;ox&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;dann meinen User mittels addusertogroup&amp;#95;ox zu dieser Gruppe hinzugefügt&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Schön, noch alles im apache.conf (/etc/apache2/conf.d/websvn) eingestellt... hm, Apache wollte nicht. Kann den User nicht zu dieser Gruppe zuordnen. Nach einer Weile forschen habe ich dann den Grund herausgefunden. Apache erwartet in dem member (hier: memberUid) Attribut einen Verweis der Form &lt;em&gt;uid=tuhlmann,ou=Users,ou=OxObjects,dc=agynamix,dc=de&lt;/em&gt; , OX schreibt aber nur den Usernamen rein. Hm, also hab ich die addusertogroup und deluserfromgroup Skripte etwas erweitert, sodass 2 Einträge geschrieben werden, einer für OX (den braucht der wirklich in dieser Form) und den, den Apache möchte. Voila. Hier die Einstellungen für den Apache Authentifizierungsmechanismus für Subversion:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;... AuthLDAPUrl &amp;quot;ldap://localhost:389/ou=Users,ou=OxObjects,dc=agynamix,dc=de?uid?sub?&amp;quot; AuthLDAPGroupAttribute &amp;quot;memberUid&amp;quot; AuthType basic AuthName &amp;quot;Subversion Entwicklerzugang&amp;quot; require group cn=developers,ou=Groups,ou=OxObjects,dc=agynamix,dc=de ...&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nun noch die 2 Änderungen:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt; addusertogroup&amp;#95;ox&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;addusertogroup&amp;#95;ox&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;addusertogroup&amp;#95;ox:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;UID&amp;#95;PART=`echo &amp;quot;$GROUP&amp;#95;BASEDN&amp;quot; | $AWK&amp;#95;BIN -F , '{ print $2&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;$3&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;$4 }'` UID&amp;#95;FULL=&amp;quot;uid=$USER,ou=Users,$UID&amp;#95;PART&amp;quot; echo &amp;quot;memberUid: $UID&amp;#95;FULL&amp;quot; &amp;gt;&amp;gt; $TMPDIF&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unter die Zeile&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;echo &amp;quot;memberUid: $USER&amp;quot; &amp;gt;&amp;gt; $TMPDIF&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;anfügen. Ähnlich in deluserfromgroup&amp;#95;ox:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;UID&amp;#95;PART=`echo &amp;quot;$GROUP&amp;#95;BASEDN&amp;quot; | $AWK&amp;#95;BIN -F , '{ print $2&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;$3&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;$4 }'` UID&amp;#95;FULL=&amp;quot;uid=$USERNAME,ou=Users,$UID&amp;#95;PART&amp;quot; echo &amp;quot;memberUid: $UID&amp;#95;FULL&amp;quot; &amp;gt;&amp;gt; $TMPDIF&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nach diesen Änderungen sollte man seine Apache Authentifizierung gegen den Open-Exchange LDAP laufen lassen können.&lt;/p&gt;

Asterisk auf Ubuntu Linux (AMD64)
</title>
<description>
&lt;p&gt;Da denkt man nun, man hat einen tollen Prozessor. Ha, Pustekuchen! Wenn man sich außerhalb der i386 Gewässer bewegt, darf man an manchen Stellen zum eigenen Schraubenzieher greifen. Aber jetzt läuft es- &lt;a href='http://blog.agynamix.de/wp-admin/www.asterisk.org'&gt;Asterisk&lt;/a&gt; (1.2.1) zusammen mit &lt;a href='http://coalescentsystems.ca/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=31&amp;Itemid=57 &quot;Asterisk Management Portal&quot;'&gt;AMP&lt;/a&gt; auf unserem Ubuntu-Server. Ich bin dabei, für den ganzen Kram eine Installanleitung zu verfassen, hier schonmal ein paar Tipps im Voraus: Für die Installation habe ich mir den Bristuff-Patch von &lt;a href='http://83.137.99.169/~junghanns.net/downloads/bristuff-0.3.0-PRE-1f.tar.gz'&gt;www.junghanns.net&lt;/a&gt; heruntergeladen (Version mit dem f hintendran), dazu dann noch den passenden &lt;a href='http://zaphfc.florz.dyndns.org/'&gt;Florz-Patch&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ins bristuff-Paket wechseln, ./download.sh tipseln und warten&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;danach Florz-Patch einspielen: &lt;code&gt;zcat /path/to/zaphfc&amp;#95;0.3.0-PRE-1f&amp;#95;florz-11.diff.gz | patch -p1&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;dann in den Verzeichnissen zaphfc und zaptel die Makefiles anpassen: dem Schalter &lt;strong&gt;KFLAGS&lt;/strong&gt; wird noch folgendes hinzugefügt: -mcmodel=kernel. Wenn man das nicht macht, lässt sich das Ganze zwar übersetzen, aber die Kernel-Module können nicht geladen werden. Dumm das. Das bringt uns zum nächsten: die Kernelquellen müssen installiert und konfiguriert sein:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;aus dem Verzeichnis /boot die entspr. config-Datei ins Kernel-Source Verzeichnis kopieren (nach .config), dann mal make menuconfig ausführen, exit auswählen und Konfiguration speichern. Danach: make prepare-all. Die Quellen werden gesucht unter /usr/src/linux bzw. /usr/src/linux-2.6. Man sollte beide symbolische Links anlegen.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mit diesen Schritten sollte sich Asterisk übersetzen lassen. Aus dem bristuff-Verzeichnis ./compile.sh aufrufen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nach der Installation des AMP-Moduls musste ich noch folgende Änderungen durchführen:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;der User, der Asterisk ausführt, ist bei mir www-data:www-data. Es gibt Probleme, wenn ein Teil als asterisk-User läuft und der Web-Teil als www-data, daher diese Anpassung. Das muss im Script /usr/sbin/amportal geändert werden.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;in /var/www/recordings/modules/settings.module: Das ARI Modul erwartet vom Asterisk Call Manager die Rückmeldung: &quot;Asterisk Call Manager 1.0&quot;, das &quot;1.0&quot; muss durch &quot;1.2&quot; ersetzt werden. 2 Positionen sind hier zu ändern.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;in /var/lib/asterisk/agi-bin/dialparties.agi gibt es 2x die Zeile &quot;$tn-&amp;gt;waitfor('/0&amp;#92;n$/');&quot;, die muss geändert werden nach: &quot;$tn-&amp;gt;waitfor('/2&amp;#92;n$/');&quot;, sonst wartet das Teil ewig mit dieser Meldung im Log: &quot;dialparties.agi: Checking CW and CFB status for extension xxx&quot;. Hu, ich kann die Haare gar nicht zählen, die mich das gekostet hat!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nuja, mit ein bißchen Glück sollte das Ganze jetzt funktionieren.&lt;/p&gt;

Unser Open Exchange Server läuft
</title>
<description>
&lt;p&gt;Hurra, es ist geschafft! Die neue OX Version (0.8.2-RC2 ... inzwischen auch die RC3 ...) ist am Laufen! Es war nicht einfach, aber es hat sich gelohnt. Auf dem Server läuft Ubuntu Breezy (es war ein Grauen, dieses auf einem Server mit zwei Raid-1 Systemen einzurichten, aber das haben wir auch geschafft). Open Exchange ist an Cyrus/Postfix/Fetchmail angebunden und läuft derzeit stabil. Ich bin dabei, ein Installationshandbuch zu verfassen, in dem alles zusammen abgehandelt wird (Cyrus-Anbindung wird in den meisten HowTo's verschwiegen). Hat jemand Interesse? Bitte melden und meine Motivation steigern :) Und weil wir gerade am Fragen sind: Hat jemand Interesse an einem Linux Business Server Installer- also ein Installer, der über eine einfache Oberfläche bedienbar, die Installation, Konfiguration und Wartung (Update) von Business-Komponenten vereinfacht:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Asterisk&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;OpenVPN&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Samba&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;DNS/DHCP&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Open Exchange&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hylafax&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wir überlegen derzeit, ob es für so etwas Bedarf gibt...&lt;/p&gt;

No Risk No F.U.N (Fülle und Noch mehr)

<description>
&lt;p&gt; Ich bin mir absolut sicher, dass mein Herr Jesus mich berufen hat, zusammen mit meiner Frau (Silvia, mit 2 &quot;i&quot; bitte) diesen Weg zu gehen. Warum ich? Keine Ahnung, nicht die leiseste. Aber das ist ja auch egal, das ist ja Gottes Entscheidung, nicht meine. Und das ist ja auch das Gute daran. Mein Herr macht nämlich keine Fehler. Und er kennt mich und meine (mannigfaltigen) Schwächen. Und trotzdem sagt er: &quot;Geh!&quot;. Somit darf ich auf seine Entscheidung vertrauen, dass er weiß, was er tut! Und noch etwas kristallisiert sich bei dieser Betrachtung heraus: es ist Seine Berufung und Seine Vision, die er austeilt. Ich tue also gut daran, dem Herrn zu folgen und nicht dem Herrn Uhlmann. Das ist also der erste Punkt, den ich herausstellen möchte: &lt;em&gt;Sei bereit, dem Herrn zu folgen, auch wenn sich Dein Leben dadurch verändert.&lt;/em&gt; Diese Berufung ist über einige Jahre in uns gewachsen. Erste Regungen traten so um 2000 herum auf. Wir haben ein bißchen darüber nachgedacht wie es wäre, selbständig zu sein und diesen Gedanken schnell wieder beiseite gelegt. Aber es ist gewachsen. Ich erinnere mich noch genau an den Herbst 2003, als John Mulinde bei uns zu Gast war. Zu dieser Zeit waren diese Gedanken größer und greifbarer in meinem Herzen. Ich wollte vieles bewegen, unsere Region voranbringen, Uganda helfen. Nur hatte ich nicht die leiseste Ahnung wie das gehen sollte. Ein paar Monate später kam George Chibubi zu uns, der mich bestärkte, weiterzuträumen. Schließlich wurden aus den Träumen Visionen, und die bewegten sich in meinem Herzen. Und wir legten sie unserem Herrn Jesus immer wieder vor, wir waren mal wieder schwanger. Zurückblickend kann ich sagen, dass der Herr uns nie überfordert hat. Wenn er uns damals gesagt hätte, wo wir heute, nur Monate später stehen würden, wären wir wahrscheinlich erschrocken davongelaufen. So hat Er uns eine Entscheidung nach der anderen vorgelegt. Unsere Aufgabe war es, gehorsam zu sein und mitzugehen. Nicht vorwärts zu sprinten, nur um eine Tür einzurennen, die Er noch gar nicht geöffnet hat. Und wir können sagen, dass uns bis hierher der Herr wunderbar versorgt hat. Es gab immer genau dann (bezahlte) Arbeit, wenn wir es gebraucht haben. &lt;img src=&quot;http://www.agynamix.de/pic/Image166.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt; Ich bin überzeugt davon, dass es möglich ist, als Kinder Gottes Ideen hervorzubringen und Kreativität an den Tag zu legen, die anderen verschlossen bleiben (&quot;was keine Auge gesehen, was kein Ohr gehört hat, das hat Gott denen bereitet, die ihn lieben&quot;). Ich denke, es gibt ein paar Grundvoraussetzungen, die erfüllt sein müssen, damit wir in den Genuss dieser bahnbrechenden Ideen kommen: · Wir müssen unsere Sorgen abgeben. Wenn wir in der Depression und dem Gedankengut unserer Zeit mitschwimmen, wird es unseren Kopf besetzt halten, sodass wir einfach keine Zeit haben, kreative Ideen zu denken. Neue Ideen klingen immer ungewohnt (sonst wären sie ja nicht neu), eine pessimistische Grundhaltung wird diese Ideen immer ablehnen. · Wir sind Individuen mit speziellen Gaben und Begabungen und wir sind geschaffen, um in Gemeinschaft zu handeln. Teamwork vervielfacht das Potential des Einzelnen. Und genau da liegt ein Knackpunkt. Wenn wir lernen, ehrlich und liebevoll miteinander umzugehen und keine Angst haben, dem anderen unsere Schwächen zu zeigen, wird es uns leicht fallen, verrückte Ideen mitzuteilen, die der andere vielleicht gar nicht so verrückt findet. Diese Einzigartigkeit gibt es nur im Leib Jesu- wenn wir es zulassen. Es ist meine Vision, in unserer Firma die Fähigkeiten Einzelner zu nehmen und durch eine herausragende Firmenkultur (die sowieso nur der Herr schaffen kann) zu potenzieren. Auf diese Weise können wir unseren Kunden einzigartige Lösungen, die nur in einer solchen Atmosphäre entstehen, anbieten. Wir sind so dankbar für unsere Leiter, für Geschwister, die einen Teil ihrer sowieso nicht vorhandenen freien Zeit opfern, um sich unsere Probleme anzuhören und uns bei unseren Entscheidungen zu helfen. Es ist weise, auf kluge Ratgeber zu hören! So ist unser Unternehmen, AGYNAMIX, also ein Produkt aus den Gebeten vieler und vor allem aus den Plänen, die unser Herr Jesus für uns hat. Ich bin so dankbar, in dieser Berufung gehen zu dürfen! Als Tipp möchte ich meinen Geschäftsleute-Kollegen noch mitgeben (wer bin ich schon, dass ich Tipps geben darf, ich mach's aber trotzdem): Die Welt um uns herum verändert sich, der Arbeitsmark verändert sich. Wenn wir nicht flexibel sind und unser Geschäftsmodell dem anpassen, werden wir auf Dauer nicht mithalten können. In meiner Branche gibt es sehr viele positive Veränderungen. So haben wir das Internet, das einen weltweiten Handel zum Kinderspiel macht. Keine Disketten mehr in Kaufhäusern verteilen- heutzutage wird Software downgeloaded (oder gedownloaded, wie Du willst). Über moderne Kommunikationsmedien (E-Mail, Instant Messenger) kann ich Kunden oder Kollegen jederzeit fast zum Nulltarif erreichen. Ich bin der Meinung, dass diese neuen Technologien in vielen Branchen ein Einsparungspotential haben. Es ist möglich, viele Dinge zu nutzen, obwohl sie aus einer anderen Branche kommen. Das Problem ist nur, dass viele mittelständige Unternehmen nicht die Mittel haben, zu forschen, welche Möglichkeiten ihnen zugute kommen würden. An dieser Stelle sollte das Teamwork ansetzen, Erfahrungsaustausch über Firmen- und Branchengrenzen hinweg, sozusagen die technische Seite des Geschäftsleutetreffens. Ach ja, Ihr fragt Euch sicherlich schon seit den ersten Worten, was unser Firmenname, AGYNAMIX, zu sagen hat: AGYNAMIX ist zusammengesetzt aus &quot;Agile&quot; und &quot;Dynamics&quot;, mit einem &quot;X&quot; statt &quot;cs&quot;. Es bedeutet Flexibilität, Agilität und Dynamik in unserem Auftreten, unseren Produkten und dem Wert, den wir für unsere Kunden darstellen. Wenn man will (ich tue es), dann kann man das &quot;X&quot; am Ende auch als Kreuz interpretieren. Schließlich hält Jesus die Firma in seiner Hand und es ist sein Blut (im Logo ist das &quot;X&quot; rot eingehüllt), das den Unterschied macht! &lt;img src=&quot;http://www.agynamix.de/pic/Image190-1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt; Dieser Artikel kann unter &lt;em&gt;http://blog.agynamix.de/?p=11&lt;/em&gt; online gelesen werden. Dort habt Ihr auch die Möglichkeit, Eure Meinung zu sagen. Torsten Uhlmann&lt;/p&gt;

Ein Linux Small Business Server
</title>
<description>
&lt;p&gt;Derzeit hab ich ein neues Steckenpferd: Einen richtig ausgewachsenen Linux Business Server. Mir gefällt das &lt;a href='http://www.open-xchange.org'&gt;openXchange-Projekt&lt;/a&gt; ziemlich gut, es ist nur recht mühsam zu installieren. Derzeit hab ich es einigermaßen am Laufen- Optimierung läuft. Zusätzlich bietet unser &lt;a href='http://www.ubuntu.com'&gt;Linux&lt;/a&gt; Server einen &lt;a href='http://www.bacula.org'&gt;Backup-Dienst&lt;/a&gt; für sich selbst und angeschlossene Clients, eine richtig tolle Asterisk-Telefonanlage, VPN-Einwahl (OpenVPN) und was ein Linux-Server eben so noch bietet (DHCP, DNS, SAMBA), all die schönen Sachen. Interessenten bitte melden! :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neulich sagte ich zu meinem Kollegen: &quot;Rinderzunge esse ich nicht&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meinte der: &quot;Ja, was andere Tiere im Mund hatten, das isst Du nicht. Lieber mal ein gekochtes Ei, nicht?&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hm...&lt;/p&gt;

Translating FogBugz
</title>
<description>
&lt;p&gt;During the last couple of days I took the time to translate the fabulous &lt;a href='http://www.fogbugz.com'&gt;FogBugz BugTracking system&lt;/a&gt;. I’ve tried a few bug tracking tools before and, quite frankly, did not intend to buy one since there are good free ones out there (even with german localization). But I then took the time to look into it since I heard from the people who should actually use the system that the free ones where too complicated. So I tried the 45 day free trial and was just overwhelmed by the simplicity it offers. Sure, you can’s tweak it into looking a whole lot different without editing the php (or asp if you install on Windows) sources, but it is in itself so well thought out that one very easily can find his way through. Now it’s also runnign in german on &lt;a href='http://issues.agynamix.de'&gt;our support site&lt;/a&gt; since we serve customers who are not used to operate english user interfaces. I guess it’s the first german localization available… &lt;strong&gt;Update (31.03.2007)&lt;/strong&gt;: The latest FogBugz version (5.0.31) is bilingual now! It comes with german and english localization. A user can change the language depending on his preferences. But that's actuay rarely necessary since FogBugz looks for the browser's settings and sets the language accordingly. Well, they seemingly did not use my translation. But I think I must get over it :) Anyway, that's great news for german users of FogBugz.&lt;/p&gt;

DPML Magic
</title>
<description>
&lt;p&gt;I’ll probably will give &lt;a href='http://dpml.net/magic/latest/'&gt;DPML Magic&lt;/a&gt; a try. I found this (below) and thought to post it here to remember myself to do it:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you like Maven, but would rather just run Ant with the resource ability, check out DPML’s Magic. DPML is what used to be Apache Avalon. It isn’t well documented yet, but if I had a blog or a confluence page online, I would surely create some. It has only been in existance for about 8 months or so, but works quite well. They best thing to do is just checkout DPML Metro via Subversion, bootstrap Magic, and then have Ant + Magic build the 10s of projects in Metro (about 10 minutes).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt; svn checkout &lt;a href=&quot;http://paris.dpml.net/svn/development/main&quot;&gt;http://paris.dpml.net/svn/development/main&lt;/a&gt;   cd main   ant -f setup.xml   ant &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;If artifacts (jars) are not found, edit your bootstrap repository in setup.properties or edit your hosts in ~/.dpml/transit/authority/hosts.xml&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;http://repository.dpml.net/classic  Is the “classic” Maven style repo.&lt;/p&gt;

The joy of having a quota
</title>
<description>
&lt;p&gt;Today all the allowed space for our AGYNAMIX user was eaten up and new files would be created but with a zero file size. Nice feature. This way one could easily destroy an existing installation of whatever. Well now I know where I can increase the quota for a user in our system.&lt;/p&gt;
